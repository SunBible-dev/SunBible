# Is That it?
Sure the code for my open source KJV Bible project can be found here, but isn't there more to SunBible than that?
(I am not that good at making readmes.)
I started SunBible about 2 years ago in the winter of 2018, I started it to put into practice the development skills I was learning.
I never dreamed that it would become what it is today.
A beautiful way to read, study and memorize the Bible.
Of course it still needs a lot of work.
