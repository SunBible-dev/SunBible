# SunBible

The Code For My Open-Source KJV BIBLE Project


# Is That it?
Sure the code for my open source KJV Bible project can be found here, but isn't there more to SunBible than that?
I started SunBible about 2 years ago in the winter of 2018, I started it to put into practice the development skills I was learning.
Took over a year break.
Restarted it in 2023.

SunBible is more than a desktop app.
But that is what this repository is.

## File Stucture of this repository

- The appx and build folders contain files to build my app for desktop.
- The BibleBase folder contains all the HTML, CSS, and JS that makes the SunBible app.

## The SunBible HTML standard
When I first stated this project this project, I had diffeerent background for every page, and lots of pictures.
My new standard is to create HTML files for every book of the Bible that can be taken and used by anyone.
