# SunBible

The Code For My Open-Source KJV BIBLE Project


# Is That it?
Sure the code for my open source KJV Bible project can be found here, but isn't there more to SunBible than that?
I started SunBible about 2 years ago in the winter of 2018, I started it to put into practice the development skills I was learning.
Took over a year break.
Restarted it in 2023.

## File Stucture of this repository

- The BibleBase folder contains all the HTML, CSS, and JS that makes the SunBible app.
- The docs folder contain docs and info, I need to write more!
- The electron folder contains the package.json and main.js file to run this as a desktop app.

## The SunBible HTML standard
When I first stated this project, I had different background for every page, and lots of pictures.
My new standard is to create HTML files for every book of the Bible that can be taken and used by anyone.
