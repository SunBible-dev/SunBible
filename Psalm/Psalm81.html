        <h1>Psalm 81</h1>
        Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.
        2 Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery.
        3 Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.
        4 For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob.
        5 This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I understood not.
        6 I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots.
        7 Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah.
        8 Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me;
        9 There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god.
        10 I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.
        11 But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me.
        12 So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they walked in their own counsels.
        13 Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways!
        14 I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.
        15 The haters of the Lord should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever.
        16 He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.
