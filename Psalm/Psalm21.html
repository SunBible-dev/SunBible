        <h1>Psalm 21</h1>
        The king shall joy in thy strength, O Lord; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!
        <br/>
        2 Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah.
        <br/>
        3 For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head.
        <br/>
        4 He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days for ever and ever.
        <br/>
        5 His glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him.
        <br/>
        6 For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance.
        <br/>
        7 For the king trusteth in the Lord, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved.
        <br/>
        8 Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.
        <br/>
        9 Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the Lord shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.
        <br/>
        10 Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.
        <br/>
        11 For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform.
        <br/>
        12 Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them.
        <br/>
        13 Be thou exalted, Lord, in thine own strength: so will we sing and praise thy power.
