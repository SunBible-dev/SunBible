        <h1>Psalm 7</h1>
        O Lord my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:
        <br/>
        2 Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.
        <br/>
        3 O Lord my God, If I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;
        <br/>
        4 If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)
        <br/>
        5 Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.
        <br/>
        6 Arise, O Lord, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded.
        <br/>
        7 So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high.
        <br/>
        8 The Lord shall judge the people: judge me, O Lord, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me.
        <br/>
        9 Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.
        <br/>
        10 My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.
        <br/>
        11 God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day.
        <br/>
        12 If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.
        <br/>
        13 He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.
        <br/>
        14 Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.
        <br/>
        15 He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.
        <br/>
        16 His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.
        <br/>
        17 I will praise the Lord according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the Lord most high.
