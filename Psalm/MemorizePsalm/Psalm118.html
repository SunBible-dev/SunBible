<span>
    3 Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.<br/>
</span><span>
    4 Let them now that fear the Lord say, that his mercy endureth for ever.<br/>
</span><span>
    5 I called upon the Lord in distress: the Lord answered me, and set me in a large place.<br/>
</span><span>
    6 The Lord is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me?<br/>
</span><span>
    7 The Lord taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.<br/>
</span><span>
    8 It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man.<br/>
</span><span>
    9 It is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in princes.<br/>
</span><span>
    10 All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the Lord will I destroy them.<br/>
</span><span>
    11 They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in the name of the Lord I will destroy them.<br/>
</span><span>
    12 They compassed me about like bees: they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the Lord I will destroy them.<br/>
</span><span>
    13 Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the Lord helped me.<br/>
</span><span>
    14 The Lord is my strength and song, and is become my salvation.<br/>
</span><span>
    15 The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly.<br/>
</span><span>
    16 The right hand of the Lord is exalted: the right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly.<br/>
</span><span>
    17 I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord.<br/>
</span><span>
    18 The Lord hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death.<br/>
</span><span>
    19 Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and I will praise the Lord:<br/>
</span><span>
    20 This gate of the Lord, into which the righteous shall enter.<br/>
</span><span>
    21 I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation.<br/>
</span><span>
    22 The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner.<br/>
</span><span>
    23 This is the Lord's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.<br/>
</span><span>
    24 This is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.<br/>
</span><span>
    25 Save now, I beseech thee, O Lord: O Lord, I beseech thee, send now prosperity.<br/>
</span><span>
    26 Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord: we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord.<br/>
</span><span>
    27 God is the Lord, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.<br/>
</span><span>
    28 Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I will exalt thee.<br/>
</span><span>
    29 O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.
