        <h1>Psalm 5</h1>
Give ear to my words, O Lord, consider my meditation.
<br/>
2 Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray.
<br/>
3 My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O Lord; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.
<br/>
4 For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.
<br/>
5 The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.
<br/>
6 Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the Lord will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.
<br/>
7 But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.
<br/>
8 Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face.
<br/>
9 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.
<br/>
10 Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.
<br/>
11 But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.
<br/>
12 For thou, Lord, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.
