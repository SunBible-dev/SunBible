        <h1>Psalm 25</h1>
        Unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
        <br/>
        2 O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine enemies triumph over me.
        <br/>
        3 Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be ashamed which transgress without cause.
        <br/>
        4 Shew me thy ways, O Lord; teach me thy paths.
        <br/>
        5 Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.
        <br/>
        6 Remember, O Lord, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they have been ever of old.
        <br/>
        7 Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness' sake, O Lord.
        <br/>
        8 Good and upright is the Lord: therefore will he teach sinners in the way.
        <br/>
        9 The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way.
        <br/>
        10 All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.
        <br/>
        11 For thy name's sake, O Lord, pardon mine iniquity; for it is great.
        <br/>
        12 What man is he that feareth the Lord? him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose.
        <br/>
        13 His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth.
        <br/>
        14 The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant.
        <br/>
        15 Mine eyes are ever toward the Lord; for he shall pluck my feet out of the net.
        <br/>
        16 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate and afflicted.
        <br/>
        17 The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my distresses.
        <br/>
        18 Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins.
        <br/>
        19 Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred.
        <br/>
        20 O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in thee.
        <br/>
        21 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.
        <br/>
        22 Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.
