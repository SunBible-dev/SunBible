        <h1>Psalm 45</h1>
        My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.
        2 Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.
        3 Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty.
        4 And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.
        5 Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; whereby the people fall under thee.
        6 Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.
        7 Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
        8 All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.
        9 Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.
        10 Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;
        11 So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord; and worship thou him.
        12 And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour.
        13 The king's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold.
        14 She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.
        15 With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king's palace.
        16 Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.
        17 I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.
