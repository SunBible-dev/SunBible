        <h1>Psalm 119</h1>
ALEPH.<br/>
 Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the LORD. <br/>
2 Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him with the whole heart.<br/>
3 They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways.<br/>
4 Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently.<br/>
5 O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!<br/>
6 Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy commandments.<br/>
7 I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments.<br/>
8 I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly.<br/>
BETH. <br/>
9 Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word.<br/>
10 With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments.<br/>
11 Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.<br/>
12 Blessed art thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes.<br/>
13 With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.<br/>
14 I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all riches.<br/>
15 I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways.<br/>
16 I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word.<br/>
<br/>GIMEL.<br/>
17 Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep thy word.<br/>
18 Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.<br/>
19 I am a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments from me.<br/>
20 My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments at all times.<br/>
21 Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do err from thy commandments.<br/>
22 Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy testimonies.<br/>
23 Princes also did sit and speak against me: but thy servant did meditate in thy statutes.<br/>
24 Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors. <br/>
DALETH. <br/>
25 My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to thy word. <br/>
26 I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy statutes. <br/>
27 Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk of thy wondrous works. <br/>
28 My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according unto thy word. <br/>
29 Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law graciously. <br/>
30 I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid before me. <br/>
31 I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put me not to shame. <br/>
32 I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart. <br/>
<br/>
HE.<br/>
33 Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it unto the end. <br/>
34 Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart. <br/>
35 Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I delight. <br/>
36 Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness. <br/>
37 Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me in thy way. <br/>
38 Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy fear. <br/>
39 Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments are good. <br/>
40 Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy righteousness. <br/>
<br/>VAU.<br/> 41 Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, even thy salvation, according to thy word. <br/>
42 So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: for I trust in thy word. <br/>
43 And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments. <br/>
44 So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever. <br/>
45 And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts. <br/>
46 I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed. <br/>
47 And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved. <br/>
48 My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.<br/>
ZAIN. <br/> 
49 Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope. <br/>
50 This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath quickened me. <br/>
51 The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not declined from thy law. <br/>
52 I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted myself. <br/>
53 Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law. <br/>
54 Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage. <br/>
55 I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have kept thy law. <br/>
56 This I had, because I kept thy precepts.<br/>
CHETH.<br/> 
57 Thou art my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy words. <br/>
58 I intreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto me according to thy word. <br/>
59 I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies. <br/>
60 I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments. <br/>
61 The bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not forgotten thy law. <br/>
62 At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments. <br/>
63 I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts. <br/>
64 The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes.<br/>
TETH. <br/>
 65 Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto thy word. <br/>
66 Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy commandments. <br/>
67 Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word. <br/>
68 Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes. <br/>
69 The proud have forged a lie against me: but I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart. <br/>
70 Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law. <br/>
71 It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes. <br/>
72 The law of thy mouth is <span class="bet-ter">better</span> unto me than thousands of gold and silver.<br/>
JOD.<br/> 
73 Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments. <br/>
74 They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped in thy word. <br/>
75 I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me. <br/>
76 Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy servant. <br/>
77 Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy law is my delight. <br/>
78 Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause: but I will meditate in thy precepts. <br/>
79 Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have known thy testimonies. <br/>
80 Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.<br/>
CAPH.<br/>
 81 My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word. <br/>
82 Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me? <br/>
83 For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not forget thy statutes. <br/>
84 How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?<br/>
85 The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy law. <br/>
86 All thy commandments are faithful: they persecute me wrongfully; help thou me. <br/>
87 They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts. <br/>
88 Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth. <br/>
LAMED.<br/> 
89 For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven. <br/>
90 Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast established the earth, and it abideth. <br/>
91 They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all are thy servants. <br/>
92 Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have perished in mine affliction. <br/>
93 I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me. <br/>
94 I am thine, save me; for I have sought thy precepts. <br/>
95 The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I will consider thy testimonies. <br/>
96 I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is exceeding broad.<br/>
MEM. <br/>
97 O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day. <br/>
98 Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they are ever with me. <br/>
99 I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation. <br/>
100 I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts. <br/>
101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word. <br/>
102 I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me. <br/>
103 How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!<br/>
104 Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way.<br/>
NUN. <br/> 
105 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. <br/>
106 I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments. <br/>
107 I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto thy word. <br/>
108 Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me thy judgments. <br/>
109 My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy law. <br/>
110 The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy precepts. <br/>
111 Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart. <br/>
112 I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even unto the end.<br/>
SAMECH.<br/> 
113 I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love. <br/>
114 Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word. <br/>
115 Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments of my God. <br/>
116 Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope. <br/>
117 Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually. <br/>
118 Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for their deceit is falsehood. <br/>
119 Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross: therefore I love thy testimonies. <br/>
120 My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments.<br/>
AIN.<br/>
121 I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine oppressors. <br/>
122 Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me. <br/>
123 Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness. <br/>
124 Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes. <br/>
125 I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies. <br/>
126 It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for they have made void thy law. <br/>
127 Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold. <br/>
128 Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right; and I hate every false way.<br/>
PE. <br/>
129 Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep them. <br/>
130 The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple. <br/>
131 I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments. <br/>
132 Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name. <br/>
133 Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over me. <br/>
134 Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy precepts. <br/>
135 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy statutes. <br/>
136 Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy law.<br/>
TZADDI.<br/>
137 Righteous art thou, O LORD, and upright are thy judgments. <br/>
138 Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and very faithful. <br/>
139 My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten thy words. <br/>
140 Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it. <br/>
141 I am small and despised: yet do not I forget thy precepts. <br/>
142 Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth. <br/>
143 Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet thy commandments are my delights. <br/>
144 The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: give me understanding, and I shall live.<br/>
KOPH. <br/>
 145 I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O LORD: I will keep thy statutes. <br/>
146 I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies. <br/>
147 I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word. <br/>
148 Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in thy word. <br/>
149 Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O LORD, quicken me according to thy judgment. <br/>
150 They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from thy law. <br/>
151 Thou art near, O LORD; and all thy commandments are truth. <br/>
152 Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever.<br/>
RESH.<br/>
153 Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget thy law. <br/>
154 Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy word. <br/>
155 Salvation is far from the wicked: for they seek not thy statutes. <br/>
156 Great are thy tender mercies, O LORD: quicken me according to thy judgments. <br/>
157 Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet do I not decline from thy testimonies. <br/>
158 I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept not thy word. <br/>
159 Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O LORD, according to thy lovingkindness. <br/>
160 Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever. <br/>
SCHIN.<br/>
161 Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart standeth in awe of thy word. <br/>
162 I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil. <br/>
163 I hate and abhor lying: but thy law do I love. <br/>
164 Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous judgments. <br/>
165 Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them. <br/>
166 LORD, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy commandments. <br/>
167 My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them exceedingly. <br/>
168 I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways are before thee.<br/>
TAU.<br/>
169 Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD: give me understanding according to thy word. <br/>
170 Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me according to thy word. <br/>
171 My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy statutes. <br/>
172 My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments are righteousness. <br/>
173 Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts. <br/>
174 I have longed for thy salvation, O LORD; and thy law is my delight. <br/>
175 Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy judgments help me. <br/>
176 I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I do not forget thy commandments. <br/>
