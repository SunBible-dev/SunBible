        <h1>Psalm 19</h1>
        The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.
        <br/>
        2 Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.
        <br/>
        3 There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.
        <br/>
        4 Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,
        <br/>
        5 Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.
        <br/>
        6 His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
        <br/>
        7 The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.
        <br/>
        8 The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.
        <br/>
        9 The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.
        <br/>
        10 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.
        <br/>
        11 Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.
        <br/>
        12 Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults.
        <br/>
        13 Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.
        <br/>
        14 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my strength, and my redeemer.
