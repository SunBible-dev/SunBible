        <h1>Psalm 62</h1>
        Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation.
        2 He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall not be greatly moved.
        3 How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering fence.
        4 They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah.
        5 My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him.
        6 He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall not be moved.
        7 In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.
        8 Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah.
        9 Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity.
        10 Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart upon them.
        11 God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God.
        12 Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work.
