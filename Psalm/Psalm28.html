        <h1>Psalm 28</h1>
        Unto thee will I cry, O Lord my rock; be not silent to me: lest, if thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit.
        2 Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.
        3 Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief is in their hearts.
        4 Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of their hands; render to them their desert.
        5 Because they regard not the works of the Lord, nor the operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up.
        6 Blessed be the Lord, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications.
        7 The Lord is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him.
        8 The Lord is their strength, and he is the saving strength of his anointed.
        9 Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also, and lift them up for ever.
