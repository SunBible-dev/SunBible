        <h1>Psalm 136</h1>
        O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.
        2 O give thanks unto the God of gods: for his mercy endureth for ever.
        3 O give thanks to the Lord of lords: for his mercy endureth for ever.
        4 To him who alone doeth great wonders: for his mercy endureth for ever.
        5 To him that by wisdom made the heavens: for his mercy endureth for ever.
        6 To him that stretched out the earth above the waters: for his mercy endureth for ever.
        7 To him that made great lights: for his mercy endureth for ever:
        8 The sun to rule by day: for his mercy endureth for ever:
        9 The moon and stars to rule by night: for his mercy endureth for ever.
        10 To him that smote Egypt in their firstborn: for his mercy endureth for ever:
        11 And brought out Israel from among them: for his mercy endureth for ever:
        12 With a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm: for his mercy endureth for ever.
        13 To him which divided the Red sea into parts: for his mercy endureth for ever:
        14 And made Israel to pass through the midst of it: for his mercy endureth for ever:
        15 But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea: for his mercy endureth for ever.
        16 To him which led his people through the wilderness: for his mercy endureth for ever.
        17 To him which smote great kings: for his mercy endureth for ever:
        18 And slew famous kings: for his mercy endureth for ever:
        19 Sihon king of the Amorites: for his mercy endureth for ever:
        20 And Og the king of Bashan: for his mercy endureth for ever:
        21 And gave their land for an heritage: for his mercy endureth for ever:
        22 Even an heritage unto Israel his servant: for his mercy endureth for ever.
        23 Who remembered us in our low estate: for his mercy endureth for ever:
        24 And hath redeemed us from our enemies: for his mercy endureth for ever.
        25 Who giveth food to all flesh: for his mercy endureth for ever.
        26 O give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his mercy endureth for ever.
