        <h1>Psalm 96</h1>
        O sing unto the Lord a new song: sing unto the Lord, all the earth.
        2 Sing unto the Lord, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day to day.
        3 Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people.
        4 For the Lord is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods.
        5 For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the Lord made the heavens.
        6 Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
        7 Give unto the Lord, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the Lord glory and strength.
        8 Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts.
        9 O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth.
        10 Say among the heathen that the Lord reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously.
        11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof.
        12 Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice
        13 Before the Lord: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.
