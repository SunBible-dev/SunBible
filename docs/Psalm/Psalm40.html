        <h1>Psalm 40</h1>
        I waited patiently for the Lord; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.
        2 He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.
        3 And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the Lord.
        4 Blessed is that man that maketh the Lord his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.
        5 Many, O Lord my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered.
        6 Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.
        7 Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,
        8 I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.
        9 I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O Lord, thou knowest.
        10 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.
        11 Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O Lord: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.
        12 For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me.
        13 Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me: O Lord, make haste to help me.
        14 Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil.
        15 Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha.
        16 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The Lord be magnified.
        17 But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou art my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.
