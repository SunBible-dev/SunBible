        <h1>Psalm 111</h1>
        Praise ye the Lord. I will praise the Lord with my whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation.
        2 The works of the Lord are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.
        3 His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth for ever.
        4 He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the Lord is gracious and full of compassion.
        5 He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant.
        6 He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen.
        7 The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure.
        8 They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness.
        9 He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name.
        10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do his commandments: his praise endureth for ever.
