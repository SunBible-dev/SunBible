        <h1>Psalm 59</h1>
        Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me.
        2 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men.
        3 For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O Lord.
        4 They run and prepare themselves without my fault: awake to help me, and behold.
        5 Thou therefore, O Lord God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah.
        6 They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.
        7 Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords are in their lips: for who, say they, doth hear?
        8 But thou, O Lord, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision.
        9 Because of his strength will I wait upon thee: for God is my defence.
        10 The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies.
        11 Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield.
        12 For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying which they speak.
        13 Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be: and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. Selah.
        14 And at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.
        15 Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied.
        16 But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble.
        17 Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God is my defence, and the God of my mercy.
