        <h1>Psalm 38</h1>
        O Lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
        2 For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.
        3 There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.
        4 For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.
        5 My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.
        6 I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.
        7 For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no soundness in my flesh.
        8 I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.
        9 Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.
        10 My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.
        11 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.
        12 They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.
        13 But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.
        14 Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.
        15 For in thee, O Lord, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.
        16 For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.
        17 For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me.
        18 For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.
        19 But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.
        20 They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow the thing that good is.
        21 Forsake me not, O Lord: O my God, be not far from me.
        22 Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.
