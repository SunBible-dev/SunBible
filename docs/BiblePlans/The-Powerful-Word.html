Word!</h1><h3 id="message-notes-brought-to-you-by-sunbible-with-the-sunshining">Message notes brought to you by <a target="_blank" href="https://the-sunshining.github.io/SunBible/">SunBible</a> with The SunShining</h3><p>(Event originally planned for Feb. 13, 2021)</p><p>(Message by Mae Renfroe)</p><hr><p><strong>Song list:</strong></p><p>There is Power in the Blood</p><p>The Little Light of Mine</p><p>I've Decided to Follow Jesus</p><blockquote><p>"But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God." - Matthew 4:4</p></blockquote><hr><p>(Welcome everyone with exuberance and excitement.<br>
Sarah or I introduce myself and my family, and the inspiration behind this meeting.)</p><h3 id="thank-you-all-so-much-for-coming-out-on-this-cool-afternoon-to-hear-this-message-ive-put-together">Thank you all so much for coming out on this cool afternoon to hear this message I've put together.</h3><p>It was about 2 months ago now when I was praying one day that the idea first came to me about bringing Jesus to the park and having this gospel meeting, and at the time I didn't have any message ready.</p><p>And I was like, “yes, Lord this is good, I want to do this, but what do I speak on and who will come out to a park in the cold to hear a gospel message. Maybe in other countries, but here? Seriously?  Here in America who wants to go out get cold and get uncomfortable for the Gospel's sake.</p><p>And as I thought of the Christians in different countries that are persecuted for their faith and will sometimes travel long distances sometimes just by foot, through the dark and cold, or rain or sleet to get to a secluded hidden area to read the Bible, sing and worship together and regardless of the danger is doing so.</p><p>So this is my theme for our meeting tonight. We have a lot to be thankful for here, we are not being persecuted and we all arrived in our warm vehicles and have hot chocolate to boot so we are pretty well off.</p><hr><h3 id="let-me-say-a-quick-prayer-for-us-before-i-get-started">Let me say a quick prayer for us before I get started.</h3><p>(Googling this more for my message I found varying articles, one said there are 232 countries, and another site 50 countries that Christianity and evangelism are illegal.</p><p>In some of these persecuted countries believers not only have to meet in secret but are brutally attacked and beaten for their faith.</p><p>And many of these people do not have the privilege of having a bible of their own either.</p><p>I've heard they have just copied pages of the Bible which are both well cherished, well-read.</p><p>Our persecuted brothers and sisters know that the Bible is both very precious and powerful.</p><p>They willingly risk their lives for their faith and once they come to know and love God they are not satisfied in just having faith to themselves.</p><p>But many, putting their own lives in great danger, diligently spread the gospel and tell others of their newfound Lord and savior!</p><p>I think the persecuted brothers and sisters have something on us that many of us don’t have. What is it that drives them to meet together in harsh and hostile environments, and to keep spreading the gospel regardless of the danger it puts them in?</p><hr><p>For a long time, I certainly didn't have that passionate fire such as I've read in stories or articles of these people like in Voice Of Martyrs magazine. Oh, I was raised in a Christian home knowing God all my life and gave my heart to Him as a child and was baptized at 14. But for far too long I was satisfied with just sitting on my faith and hiding my little light, and I do mean little, under a bushel. ( you know the song this little light of mine )</p><p>But more recently I've become passionate about sharing my faith and hope that I have in Jesus with others, and the power of His word because sadly even many that are called by His name are still walking in bondage to the things of this World and not walking in the power and freedom God offers. It’s time to be set free and truly walk in the power of God! It's time to come alive and truly live! ( not like dead sheep )</p><p>Recently I was reading this looking book called The Jabez Prayer, and I got partway through it and was thinking to myself, “ wow, this is a powerful little book.” Then the thought came to me, “ when was the last time I said that about the Bible.” OUch!!</p><p>I'm wondering if we realize just how precious and powerful this book is? And how very blessed we are to have it. Here in America we not only have easy access to Bibles, but also several different versions, but are we even taking the time to get in our Bibles? And do we realize what we are holding?</p><p>This Word gives life, brings hope, sets that captive free, changes, and transforms our lives. His word is timeless &amp; forever and His promises everlasting. Just as our persecuted brothers and sisters know.</p><hr><h4 id="god’s-word-is-forever">God’s Word is forever!</h4><p>"The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it: surely the people are grass.<br>
The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand forever.<br>
So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it."<br>
Isaiah 50:7-8,11</p><p>Matthew 24:35 says,<br>
“Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will by no means pass away.”</p><h4 id="the-word-was-precious-in-those-days">The Word was precious in those days.</h4><p>"And the child Samuel ministered unto the Lord before Eli. And the word of the Lord was precious in those days; there was no open vision." - 1 Samuel 3:1</p><p>"Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path." - Psalm 119:105 KJV</p><h4 id="the-word-will-set-us-free">The Word will set us free</h4><p>"And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him. 30 As he spake these words, many believed on him.<br>
Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;<br>
And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free<br>

That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works."</p><ul><li>2 Timothy 3: 16-17</li></ul><p>"Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee." Psalms 119:11 KJV</p><h4 id="and-the-word-of-the-lord-is-powerful">And the Word of the Lord is powerful</h4><blockquote><p>For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God. - 1 Corinthians 1:18 KJV</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. - Romans 1:16 KJV</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. - Hebrews 4:12 KJV</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart. - Hebrews 4:12 NIV</p></blockquote><h4 id="the-word-is-powerful-because-our-god-is-powerful">The Word is powerful because our God is powerful!!</h4><p>We can stand on His word and promises because the God of the universe, the One who breathed everything into existence, the creator of you, and I stands behind His word. His power can never diminish and His glory never fades.</p><blockquote><p>"Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever." - Hebrews 13:8</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent." - 1 Samuel 15:29</p></blockquote><h4 id="and--jesus-is-the-way-the-truth-and-the-life">And  Jesus is the way the truth and the life</h4><blockquote><p>Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.<br>
If you really know me, you will know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him.”</p><ul><li>John 14:6</li></ul></blockquote><blockquote><p>Have you not known?

He does not faint or grow weary; his understanding is unsearchable. - Isaiah 40: 28</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty. - Revelation 1:8 KJV</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>So he answered and said to me: “This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel: ‘Not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit, Says the Lord of hosts. - Zechariah 4:6 NKJV</p></blockquote><p>Isaiah 46:9-10 says,</p><blockquote><p>“Remember the former things of old, For I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like Me,  Declaring the end from the beginning, And from ancient times things that are not yet done, Saying, ‘My counsel shall stand, And I will do all My pleasure,’”</p></blockquote><h4 id="god’s-will-never-changes">God’s will never changes.</h4><p>Psalm 33:11 says,</p><blockquote><p>“The counsel of the Lord stands forever, The plans of His heart to all generations.”</p></blockquote><h4 id="his-word-is-timeless-and-his-promises-are-everlasting">His Word is Timeless and His Promises are Everlasting!</h4><p>Matthew 24:35 says,</p><blockquote><p>“Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will by no means pass away.”</p></blockquote><h4 id="god’s-counsel-never-changes">God’s counsel never changes.</h4><p>Through Jesus, we have life, the forgiveness of sins, and the victory over sin and Satan<br>
Then why do we that are called Christians not walking free from the things of this world and walking in the power and the Might of God?<br>
Is it maybe because we truly have not surrendered our life for His life, our will for His will, &amp; made Him the Lord of our lives?</p><p>Maybe it’s the concepts we go by, such as give heart to the Lord, accept Jesus into your life, Give your life to the Lord, make the confession to salvation.</p><p>And we do that, and that's good, that's where we start, but too often we do that, make the prayer, go through the motions, and then go our way and follow the world. But the Bible says "we are to be followers God as dear children" in Ephesians 5:1-10.</p><hr><p>"Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;</p><p>And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.</p><p>But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;</p><p>Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.</p><p>For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</p><p>Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.</p><p>Be not ye therefore partakers with them.</p><p>For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light:</p><p>(For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)</p><p>Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord"</p><ul><li>Ephesains  5: 1-10</li></ul><hr><p>"The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</p><p>But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.</p><p>Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,</p><p>Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?</p><p>Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.</p><p>Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless."</p><ul><li>2 Peter 3: 9-14</li></ul><hr><p>The Power of His Word is available to you. I want you to know that salvation and a life in Christ are available to you right here and right now. Through Jesus we are forgiven from our sins, receive the gift of salvation, and promised eternal life forever with Him in heaven.</p><blockquote><p>From that time on Jesus began to preach, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.” - Matthew 4:17 (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea and saying, ‘Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.’” - Matthew 3:1-3 (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance." - 2 Peter 3:9</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"Whoever conceals their sins does not prosper, but the one who confesses and renounces them finds mercy." - Proverbs 28:13</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“I tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who do not need to repent.” - Luke 15:7 (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord.” - Acts 3:19 (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Opponents must be gently instructed, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth.” - 2 Timothy 2:25</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>But if a wicked person turns away from all the sins they have committed and keeps all my decrees and does what is just and right, that person will surely live; they will not die. None of the offenses they have committed will be remembered against them. Because of the righteous things they have done, they will live. Do I take any pleasure in the death of the wicked? declares the Sovereign Lord. Rather, am I not pleased when they turn from their ways and live?” - Ezekiel 18:21-23 (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>But because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of God’s wrath, when his righteous judgment will be revealed.” - Romans 2:5 (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish." - Luke 13:3 (KJV)</p></blockquote><p>"All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.<br>
Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:<br>
Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen." - Matthew 28:18-20</p><hr><h4 id="god-is-faithful-and-just">GOD IS FAITHFUL AND JUST</h4><p>Repentance and, in turn, forgiveness, show God’s love for us through his willingness to purify us from our poor choices and sins.</p><blockquote><p>“If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.” - 1 John 1:9 (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin and will heal their land.” - 2 Chronicles 7:14 (NIV)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.” - John 3:16 (NIV</p></blockquote><hr><h3 id="are-you-willing-to-take-the-steps-it-requires-to-have-salvation-in-christ-and-the-hope-of-heaven">Are you willing to take the steps it requires to have salvation in Christ and the hope of heaven?</h3><p><strong>First step:</strong> You must know that all have sinned</p><p>We have all sinned and therefore fall short of God's standard.</p><blockquote><p>"As it is written , There is none righteous, no, not one." - Romans 3:10</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"For all have sinned , and come short of the glory of God". - Romans 3:23</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"Wherefore , as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned". - Romans 5:12</p></blockquote><p><strong>Second step:</strong> You must know that there is a penalty for sin</p><p>If we remain in our sin, we have the condemnation of death upon us, but if we repent and accept Jesus Christ as our Saviour, we receive eternal life.</p><blockquote><p>"For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." - Romans 6:23</p></blockquote><p><strong>Third step:</strong> You must know that Christ died for (YOU)</p><p>Even though we are sinners, God loves us (you) and sent His beloved Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, to die in our (your) place and take the punishment of our sin.</p><blockquote><p>"But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." - Romans 5:8</p></blockquote><p><strong>Fourth step:</strong> You must call upon the Lord</p><p>We must call upon the Lord. God promises that when we call upon the name of the Lord we will be saved. There is no other name through which we can receive salvation.</p><blockquote><p>"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved." - Romans 10:13</p></blockquote><p><strong>Fifth step:</strong> You must believe and confess</p><p>We must believe in our hearts that Jesus died and shed his spotless blood, was buried, and rose again for our sins (1 Corinthians 15:1-4), but we must also confess out loud with our mouth that he is lord and savior.</p><blockquote><p>"That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation." - Romans 10: 9-10</p></blockquote><p><strong>Sixth step:</strong> You must know that it is a faith walk</p><p>We receive God's salvation by faith. When we are saved, we keep walking by faith, which grows stronger as we read His word and experience His power.</p><blockquote><p>"Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God." - Romans 10:17</p></blockquote><p>If you have never made Jesus Christ the king of your life and if you have never been born again or if your children are not yet born again, here is a prayer to pray.</p><blockquote><p>" Dear Father, I know that I have sinned and deserve the punishment of my sin, which is death. But I thank you that you have died in my place, and took my sin upon yourself as you died upon the cross and poured out your blood. Please forgive me for my sin and cleanse me with your precious blood. I thank you that you died, were buried, and rose again for me. I ask you to come into my life and to be the lord of my life. I confess aloud right now: JESUS CHRIST IS THE LORD AND SAVIOR OF MY LIFE. amen"</p></blockquote><h4 id="what-there-are-more-steps">What! There are more steps?</h4><p>If you died right after the last step then you won't have to take anymore but when you are born again you have to keep on walking and growing into your faith. But you don't do it alone! If you asked Jesus to be the Lord of your life he will be with you every step of the way!</p><hr><p>If you are praying this for the first time or rededicating your life to God, this your moment this is your time, don't put it off.</p><p>The gospel does not allow sinners to stay in sin. The gospel leads to the obedience of faith. That is the gospel in a nutshell. Jesus came, Jesus saves, so you will obey and glorify Him.</p><p>Follow God and repent and turn away from our sins.<br>
Not just add God to our lives. But rather turn our lives completely around!<br>
As we turn our lives over to Him we are to put off the things of the world.<br>
We turn our faces and lives to God and the things of God, and our backs on the world.<br>
No turning back.<br>
As the song goes I’ve decided to follow Jesus.</p><p>“For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.”</p><ul><li>Ephesians 2:8-10</li></ul><hr><p>There is a life to live for Christ. Commandments to keep. A role to play.  Those that do the will of the Father.</p><p>"Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.<br>
Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?<br>
And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.  ( some versions say lawlessness )<br>
Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:<br>
And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.<br>
And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:<br>
And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it."</p><ul><li>Mathew 7:21-27</li></ul><p>"But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren?<br>
And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!<br>
For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother."</p><ul><li>Mathew 12:48-50</li></ul><hr><p>There is power in the Word! The Word changes and transforms lives.<br>
Sets people free. The word is full of life and power.<br>
The Bible brings life and hope. We are to meditate day and night.</p><p>Hearing the Word of God initiates Faith.</p><p>Speaking the Word of God activates Faith.</p><p>Doing the Word of God demonstrates Faith.</p><p>We can take Jesus at His Word, His word stands, We can take His Word literally.<br>
We can stand on His Word and His promises.<br>
We should never take what we want and leave what we want when it comes to God’s word.</p><p>There is power in His name. There is power in the blood of the lamb.</p><p>There may be a lot of bad news in the world right now, but this is good news right here.<br>
Really, really good news! But we got to do something with it.</p><p>It’s not enough to just hear or know the Word, but we have to let the Word penetrate every part of our being and allow it to change us from the inside out, and live it out daily. There is a life to live for Christ. Commandments to keep. A role to play. Those that do the will of the Father.</p><p>The question is what will you do with the Word? The word is alive and active, are we going to allow it to activate us into action. The word is powerful, are we going to let it transform us into the image and likeness of God’s son? The word sets the captive free, will you be set free from sins, addictions, lust, envy? Do you want to be set free? The Word gives hope, will you accept that hope today?</p><p>It’s not what we know. But it's what we do with what we know. It’s got to go from head knowledge to a heart connection and a relationship with God. It’s only then that we experience God fully working in us and through us.</p><p>When we give our lives to God that’s not where we stop, that's only the starting point. Then we go on and live our lives for God. And we have the hope of heaven one day when Jesus returns to take His people home. That is like our reward, but not our goal. God is our goal and heaven in our reward. We got to want God more than anything else in this world. I've done a Youtube series called Is is God we Really Want or just heaven? You will probably want to watch those. In those, I talk about how it appears people seem to want heaven more than they God. Oh, they want heaven when life is over here certainly, but they want to live their lives for God now, completely surrendered trading in our will for His. But if it's not God we want now, the hope of heaven is not what we will have later. If it’s not God we want now and all it entails to live a life for Him, it will not be God or heaven we will have later.</p><p>I want you to go away from here challenged to let the power of God and his word change you. Do you want freedom? What's holding you captive? Do you want victory from sins? Do you want peace in your life? Do you want to find a purpose for your pain? Do you want more meaning in life than what you've got? More power of God than what you have been experiencing?<br>
Maybe you’ve been in church your whole life but it’s been more of a head knowledge for you and not a heart connection, or you had been all in at some point but you've allowed sin to slipped in, or maybe some tragedy has taken place in your life and you haven't understood how a loving God could have allowed that to happen and now hurt and bitterness has put a barrier between your heart and God. Or maybe tonight you've heard the gospel for the first time and you're saying Yes to Jesus for the very first time. Whichever way it is for you this evening I encourage you to jump in with both feet and go all in, holding nothing back. But surrendering all. Giving up your will for His.</p><p>It’s then that you will be able to experience the power of God in your life, and experience joy, peace, and victory from sin. Mark Batterson says if we are not willing to go all in and all out for God then we are probably not in at all. And also being in that place of calling ourselves Christians but not being all in and fully committed and surrendered and really just turn us off from God and turn others off too. Because we will not be producing the fruits of the spirit in our lives and experience what all God has for us and we won’t want it and others too will feel like if that is what Christianity is I don’t want it. But a true life lived for God is appealing.<br>
No matter what you are going through today, you can place your faith, trust, and hope in the God of the Bible through His Son Jesus Christ.</p><hr><h3 id="i-just-want--to-close-with-this">I just want  to Close with this:</h3><p>One day  this past fall my 5-year-old Daniel came running up to me and asked, “Mom, am I a kid?”<br>

I'm like, “whew” that was good.</p><p>You know that's what I think about my relationship with God, it's fun being his kid!<br>
No, the road isn’t always smooth or easy.<br>

As the song goes in "I've decided to follow Jesus".</p><hr><p>"My cross I'll carry till I see Jesus;</p><p>No turning back, No turning back.</p><p>The world behind me, the cross before me,</p><p>The world behind me, the cross before me;</p><p>The world behind me, the cross before me;</p><p>No turning back.</p><p>My cross I'll carry till I see Jesus;</p><p>No turning back, No turning back."</p><hr><p>The God we serve today is the exact same God we served prior to COVID-19 entering the scene. He is the same God today as He was the day He raised Jesus from the Grave. He is the same God today as He was when He spoke the world into existence. He is the God who saves and He is the God in whom you can place your hope! If God never changes, then that means His love is forever. His forgiveness is forever. His salvation is forever. His promises are forever.</p><p>Romans 11:29 says,</p><blockquote><p>“For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.”</p></blockquote><p>If God has ever been good, then He will always be good because He never changes! He is trustworthy! The question is: Do you trust Him? No matter what you are going through today, place your faith, trust, and hope in the God of the Bible through His Son Jesus Christ. It will be an unshakeable hope with an unshakeable foundation<br>
