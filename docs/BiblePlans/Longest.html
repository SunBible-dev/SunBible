     What one word comes to your mind when you think of Psalm 119? 
     Probably the word Longest, right. 
     That is because Psalm 119 is the Longest chapter in the Bible.
      Well, Longest is the title of this book, not because this book is the longest book, 
      but because it is a devotional book with Psalm 119 included within its pages. 
      This is actually a very short book, wrote by a teenager, but I hope you enjoy and learn a lot from it.

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
    Hi my name is N.C.R. and I love studing the bible.
    I also love helping others study the bible to. A few years ago, around 2016, I wrote this book titled "Longest". 
    I was 16 when I wrote the book.
    I am now 19, and have created this website called SunBible.
And on this website I created this thing called bible plans. 
And for one of the bible plans, this one acctualy, I use some of the content from that book.
</p>
<p>
Psalm 119 is devided in 22 parts each 8 verses long. 
Each day we will take a look at a different part. 
And hopfuly together we can learn a lot from psalm 119.
If you want to share any thoughs or question as you study psalm 119 feel free to send them to
 <a href="mailto:thesunshiningmin@gmail.com">thesunshiningmin@gmail.com</a>.
And from there I will share them with the commuinty. Also you could join the

<h1>ALEPH.</h1>
<p>Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the LORD. <br/>
    2 Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him with the whole heart. <br/>
    3 They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways. <br/>
    4 Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently.<br/> 
    5 O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes! <br/>
    6 Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy commandments.<br/>
     7 I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments.<br/>
      8 I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly.<br/>

        <h1>A Little Thought By N.C.R.</h1>
        <b>Sept. 12, 2019</b> <br/>
        <p>Psalm 119 starts off with 2 blessed verses. So I think I'll start the same way.
Except I will share more than 2 blessed verses. But first I'll share a little thought with you.</p>
Recently a new though struck me about blessings. It is kind of somthing I have know for a while.
It just struck me in a new way. 
See what I have know for a while is that blessings are something you have to earn.
What hit me, was that God is kind of like humans, or vice versa.
You see people don't just go around blessing others for no reason, 
and people certainly don't bless you when you harm them or mistreat them.
That is kind of the way it is with God.
He has set standards and laws that he requires you to follow if you want blessed.
I just read Deuteronomy a few days ago and loved chapter 28. I recommed you read it, the come back here.
<p>
       Your Back!<br/> 
        If you juest read Deuteronomy 28, then below are a few more great verses. I call them Blessed verses.
        Because each of the verses have the the word blessed in it.<br/>
        Did you know I created a tea/coffe cup collection with theses verses? You can find that collection at:

</div>
<div class="DevoBox">
<b>Closing thought:</b><br/>
The first 8 verses of Psalm 119 talk about a lot more than just blessing. 
Actually only the the first 2 verses have the word Blessed in them.
In the last few verses David is kind of asking God to help him.
If I or these verses have not made it clear enough.<br/>
God Loves You!<br/>
He wants to help you follow His law so that He can bless you.
In fact it is impossible to earn blessings on your own.
You will need God's help. So take time right now, humble yourself and ask God to help you.

            <h1>BETH.</h1>
            Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word.
             10 With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments.
              11 Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee. 
              12 Blessed art thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes. 
              13 With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth. 
              14 I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all riches. 
              15 I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways.

                                        Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee. - Psalm 119:11
                        </p>
                        This verse makes it clear that Bible memorization is important.
                         And guess what this verse was written before verses like John 3:16 where written.
                         People back then in David's time had the first 5 books of the bible memorized.
                         That was their scripture. I wonder how many people today have the 10 commandments memorized?

                        <h1>How to Cleanse Your way</h1>
                        <p>
                        Psalm 119:9-16 starts with a question.
                         A very important question I might add.
                          It is a question that many struggle with. 
                          The question is “How shall we cleanse Our way?”. 
                          We all need an answer to this question because we are all sinners who need our way cleaned.  
                          Luckily for us Psalm 119:9 gives us the answer: “By taking heed to God's word”.  
            </p>
            <p>
                       You may be wondering “how is that a way to cleanse my way?”. 
                       Well God's word is filled with laws and commands and by taking heed to them your way will be cleansed.
                        God's word is also filled with encouragement to help you cleanse your way.

                113 I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love.
                 114 Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word. 
                 115 Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments of my God.
                  116 Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope. 
                  117 Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually.
                   118 Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for their deceit is falsehood. 
                   119 Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross: therefore I love thy testimonies. 
                   120 My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments.

<div id="Conclusion">
              <h1>  Conclusion </h1>
                We are both just about done with this 22 day study of Psalm 119. 
                I think we have both learned a lot.
                 You may be thinking that you can now walk away from this book and continue life as you used to live it.
                  But you can't. If you have learned things, then you need to start acting upon them. 
                  It won't be easy to adjust your life, but you can take the first step by saying “I will”.<br/>
               Say “I will...<br/>
              …See Verse List (Notice how many are from Psalm 119)<br/>
               Saying “I will” is only a first small easy step. 
               The second step, doing it, is much harder and will take much more time. 
               Really if you are a Christian your whole life should be dedicated to doing the will of God. 
               Many people think they have to become missionaries to serve God and so do not even try to serve God or 
               do His will because they think they have to go all the way around the world to do it.
                But you can be a missionary right there in your home, at your job site, and/or anywhere else you happen to be. 
                Plus you should live your life in such a way that when your end is near you will be able to say “I have”.
              <p>
              Able to  say “I have” like David: “I have kept Thy precepts and Thy testimonies: for all my ways are before Thee.”
              Able to say “l have” like Paul: "I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith"
               Or you may have to end up saying:
                “I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I do not forget thy commandments.” 
                But hopefully you won't have to end up saying that. 
                The truth is we all make mistakes, and when we do we need to be humble enough to confess it to God.
