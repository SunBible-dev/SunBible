# App Frame Themes

I created the "BibleBase/appTheme" folder for the js and css files for different themes.



theme-iframe.html - with color theme options
- BibleBase/appTheme/theme-iframe.html
- css, and js files

dark_and_light.html
- BibleBase/appTheme/dark_and_light.html
- just left the css and js the same for now
