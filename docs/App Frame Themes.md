# App Frame Themes

I created the "BibleBase/appTheme" folder for the js and css files for different themes.

It doesn't workd to put the html pages in there.

### BibleBase/app-iframe.html
This is the main app iframe, the index redirects to this and it is used for desktop app.

### BibleBase/android-iframe.html
This is used for android app because iframe would not load properly on android app.
