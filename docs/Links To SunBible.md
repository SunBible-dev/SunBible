# Links to SunBible

Links to SunBible are interesting, because if you give a link to the app iframe it will always open to Genesis.

If you give a link to a book page, it will not be in the app iframe.

Here is the documentation on how I fix that.


## Script for appiframe

Bookref.js to load referrer links in iframe.


*Valueref*

http://example.com?ref=abc123

This script should load url in app iframe

?ref=https://sunbible-dev.github.io/SunBible/BibleBooksHTML/Book-id=3-Leviticus.html#Leviticus5


## Book Script

Need to write this.
