                <span class="red"> Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward</span>.
                <br/><span class="red"> But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face</span>;
                <br/><span class="red"> That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly</span>.

                And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?
                <br/>And he said unto them,<span class="red"> This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting</span>.

                Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.
                <br/>And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred.
                <br/>And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.
                <br/>But he answered and said, <span class="red">It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</span>

                Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?
                <br/>And Jesus said unto them,<span class="red">Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.</span>

                Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the Lord?
                <br/>Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?
                <br/>Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh?
