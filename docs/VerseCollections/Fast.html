                Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
                But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;
                That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.
            "</p>

                And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?
                 And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.
