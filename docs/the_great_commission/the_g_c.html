                    6 When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?
                    7 And he said unto them, <span class="red">It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power</span>.
                    8 <span class="red">But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth</span>.

<h3>Are you willing to take the steps it requires to get to heaven?</h3>

<h5>First step: You must know that all have sinned</h5>
<p>We have all sinned and therefore fall short of God's standard.</p>
<p class="R_R_Verse">
"As it is written , There is none righteous, no, not one." - Romans 3:10 <br/>
"For all have sinned , and come short of the glory of God". - Romans 3:23<br/>
"Wherefore , as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin;
 and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned". - Romans 5:12
 </p>

<h5>Second step: You must know that there is a penalty for sin</h5>
<p>
If we remain in our sin, we have the condemnation of death upon us, 
but if we repent and accept Jesus Christ as our Saviour, we receive eternal life.
</p>
<p class="R_R_Verse">"For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord." - Romans 6:23</p>

<h5>Third step: You must know that Christ died for (YOU)</h5>
<p>
Even though we are sinners, God loves us (you) and sent His beloved Son, 
the Lord Jesus Christ, to die in our (your) place and take the punishment of our sin.
</p>
<p class="R_R_Verse">"But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."
    - Romans 5:8 </p>

<h5>Fourth step: You must call upon the Lord</h5>
<p>
We must call upon the lord. God promises that when we call upon the name of the Lord we will be saved.
There is no other name through which we can receive salvation.
</p>
<p class="R_R_Verse">"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved." 
 - Romans 10:13</p>

<h5>Fifth step: You must believe and confess</h5>
<p>
We must believe in our hearts that Jesus died and shed his spotless blood, was buried ,
and rose again for our sins (1 Corinthians 15:1-4),
but we must also confess out loud with our mouth that he is lord and savior.
</p>
<p class="R_R_Verse">
"That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."
- Romans 10: 9-10
</p>

<h5>Sixth step: You must know that it is a faith walk</h5>
<p>
    We receive God's salvation by faith.
When we are saved, we keep walking by faith, which grows stronger as we read His word and experience His power.
</p>
<p class="R_R_Verse">"Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God." - Romans 10:17</p>

<p>
    <u>
  If you have never made Jesus Christ the king of your life and if you have never been born again or if your children are not yet born again, here is a prayer to pray.
 </u>
</p>
<p>
  " Dear Father, I know that I have sinned and deserve the punishment of my sin, which is death.
  But I thank you that you have died in my place, and took my sin upon yourself as you died upon
  the cross and poured out your blood. Please forgive me for my sin and cleanse me with your precious blood.
  I thank you that you died, were buried, and rose again for me.
  I ask you to come into my life and to be the lord of my life. I confess aloud right now:
  JESUS CHRIST IS THE LORD AND SAVIOR OF MY LIFE. amen"
</p>


<p>
  <b>What! There are more steps?</b><br/>
If you died right after the last step then you won't have to take anymore
but when you are born again you have to keep on walking and growing into your faith.
But you don't do it alone! If you asked Jesus to be the Lord of your life he will be with you every step of the way!
