            This is the start of the Israelites time in the promised Land.
            And the main person of this time was <span class="WTB">Joshua</span>.<br/>
            Thre are also two Walk through the Bible steps from ot live 
            that fit in this time zone but they sound funny on a timeline.
            Here they are: <span class="WTB">Divide Conquer</span> and <span class="WTB">12 Tribes</span>.<br/>
            If its been a while since you read about how Joshua led the isralites to victory as they 
            conquered and divided the land between the 12 tribes read the book of
            <a href="../Joshua.html">Joshua</a>
