<h1>The Book of Proverbs</h1>






<div class="ChapterNumber"><h1>Proverbs 1</h1></div>
<div id="Proverbs1" class="Chapter">
The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;<br/>
2 To know <span class="Wisdom">wisdom</span> and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;<br/>
3 To receive the instruction of <span class="Wisdom">wisdom</span>, justice, and judgment, and equity;<br/>
4 To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.<br/>
5 A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:<br/>
6 To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.<br/>
7 <span class="TheFearOfTheLord">The fear of the Lord</span> is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise <span class="Wisdom">wisdom</span> and instruction.<br/>
8 <span class="MySon">My son</span>, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:<br/>
9 For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.<br/>
10 <span class="MySon">My son</span>, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.<br/>
11 If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:<br/>
12 Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:<br/>
13 We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:<br/>
14 Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:<br/>
15 <span class="MySon">My son</span>, walk not thou in the <span class="way">way</span> with them; refrain thy foot from their <span class="path">paths</span>:<br/>
16 For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.<br/>
17 Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.<br/>
18 And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives.<br/>
19 So are the <span class="way">ways</span> of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the <span class="li-fe">life</span> of the owners thereof.<br/>
20 <span class="Wisdom">wisdom</span> crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:<br/>
21 She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,<br/>
22 How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?<br/>
23 Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.<br/>
24 Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;<br/>
25 But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:<br/>
26 I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;<br/>
27 When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.<br/>
28 Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:<br/>
29 For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose <span class="TheFearOfTheLord">The fear of the Lord</span>:<br/>
30 They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.<br/>
31 Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own <span class="way">way</span>, and be filled with their own devices.<br/>
32 For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.<br/>
33 But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.<br/>

<div class="ChapterNumber"><h1>Proverbs 2</h1></div>
<div id="Proverbs2" class="Chapter">
<span class="MySon">My son</span>, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;<br/>
2 So that thou incline thine ear unto <span class="Wisdom">wisdom</span>, and apply thine heart to understanding;<br/>
3 Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding;<br/>
4 If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures;<br/>
5 Then shalt thou understand <span class="TheFearOfTheLord">The fear of the Lord</span>, and find the knowledge of God.<br/>
6 For the Lord giveth <span class="Wisdom">wisdom</span>: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.<br/>
7 He layeth up sound <span class="Wisdom">wisdom</span> for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.<br/>
8 He keepeth the <span class="path">paths</span> of judgment, and preserveth the <span class="way">way</span> of his saints.<br/>
9 Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good <span class="path">path</span>.<br/>
10 When <span class="Wisdom">wisdom</span> entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;<br/>
11 Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:<br/>
12 To deliver thee from the <span class="way">way</span> of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things;<br/>
13 Who leave the <span class="path">paths</span> of uprightness, to walk in the <span class="way">ways</span> of darkness;<br/>
14 Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked;<br/>
15 Whose <span class="way">ways</span> are crooked, and they froward in their <span class="path">paths</span>:<br/>
16 To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words;<br/>
17 Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.<br/>
18 For her house inclineth unto death, and her <span class="path">paths</span> unto the dead.<br/>
19 None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the <span class="path">paths</span> of <span class="li-fe">life</span>.<br/>
20 That thou mayest walk in the <span class="way">way</span> of good men, and keep the <span class="path">paths</span> of the righteous.<br/>
21 For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.<br/>
22 But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.<br/>

<div class="ChapterNumber"><h1>Proverbs 3</h1></div>
<div id="Proverbs3" class="Chapter">
<span class="MySon">My son</span>, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments:<br/>
2 For length of days, and long <span class="li-fe">life</span>, and peace, shall they add to thee.<br/>
3 Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:<br/>
4 So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.<br/>
5 Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.<br/>
6 In all thy <span class="way">ways</span> acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy <span class="path">paths</span>.<br/>
7 Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the Lord, and depart from evil.<br/>
8 It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.<br/>
9 Honour the Lord with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:<br/>
10 So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.<br/>
11 <span class="MySon">My son</span>, despise not the chastening of the Lord; neither be weary of his correction:<br/>
12 For whom the Lord loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.<br/>
13 Happy is the man that findeth <span class="Wisdom">wisdom</span>, and the man that getteth understanding.<br/>
14 For the merchandise of it is <span class="bet-ter">better</span> than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.<br/>
15 She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.<br/>
16 Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour.<br/>
17 Her <span class="way">ways</span> are <span class="way">ways</span> of pleasantness, and all her <span class="path">paths</span> are peace.<br/>
18 She is a tree of <span class="li-fe">life</span> to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her.<br/>
19 The Lord by <span class="Wisdom">wisdom</span> hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.<br/>
20 By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.<br/>
21 <span class="MySon">My son</span>, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound <span class="Wisdom">wisdom</span> and discretion:<br/>
22 So shall they be <span class="li-fe">life</span> unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.<br/>
23 Then shalt thou walk in thy <span class="way">way</span> safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.<br/>
24 When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.<br/>
25 Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.<br/>
26 For the Lord shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.<br/>
27 Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.<br/>
28 Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.<br/>
29 Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.<br/>
30 Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.<br/>
31 Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his <span class="way">ways</span>.<br/>
32 For the froward is abomination to the Lord: but his secret is with the righteous.<br/>
33 The curse of the Lord is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.<br/>
34 Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.<br/>
35 The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.<br/>

<div class="ChapterNumber"><h1>Proverbs 4</h1></div>
<div id="Proverbs4" class="Chapter">
Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.<br/>
2 For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.<br/>
3 For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.<br/>
4 He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.<br/>
5 Get <span class="Wisdom">wisdom</span>, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.<br/>
6 Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.<br/>
7 <span class="Wisdom">wisdom</span> is the principal thing; therefore get <span class="Wisdom">wisdom</span>: and with all thy getting get understanding.<br/>
8 Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.<br/>
9 She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.<br/>
10 Hear, O <span class="MySon">My son</span>, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy <span class="li-fe">life</span> shall be many.<br/>
11 I have taught thee in the <span class="way">way</span> of <span class="Wisdom">wisdom</span>; I have led thee in right <span class="path">paths</span>.<br/>
12 When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.<br/>
13 Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy <span class="li-fe">life</span>.<br/>
14 Enter not into the <span class="path">path</span> of the wicked, and go not in the <span class="way">way</span> of evil men.<br/>
15 Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.<br/>
16 For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.<br/>
17 For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.<br/>
18 But the <span class="path">path</span> of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.<br/>
19 The <span class="way">way</span> of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.<br/>
20 <span class="MySon">My son</span>, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.<br/>
21 Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.<br/>
22 For they are <span class="li-fe">life</span> unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.<br/>
23 Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of <span class="li-fe">life</span>.<br/>
24 Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.<br/>
25 Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.<br/>
26 Ponder the <span class="path">path</span> of thy feet, and let all thy <span class="way">ways</span> be established.<br/>
27 Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.<br/>
</div>

<div class="ChapterNumber"><h1>Proverbs 5</h1></div>
<div id="Proverbs5" class="Chapter">
<span class="MySon">My son</span>, attend unto my <span class="Wisdom">wisdom</span>, and bow thine ear to my understanding:<br/>
2 That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.<br/>
3 For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:<br/>
4 But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.<br/>
5 Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.<br/>
6 Lest thou shouldest ponder the <span class="path">path</span> of <span class="li-fe">life</span>, her <span class="way">ways</span> are moveable, that thou canst not know them.<br/>
7 Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.<br/>
8 Remove thy <span class="way">way</span> far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:<br/>
9 Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel:<br/>
10 Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger;<br/>
11 And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,<br/>
12 And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;<br/>
13 And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!<br/>
14 I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.<br/>
15 Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.<br/>
16 Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets.<br/>
17 Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.<br/>
18 Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.<br/>
19 Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.<br/>
20 And why wilt thou, <span class="MySon">My son</span>, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?<br/>
21 For the <span class="way">ways</span> of man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his goings.<br/>
22 His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.<br/>
23 He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.<br/>
</div>

<div class="ChapterNumber"><h1>Proverbs 6</h1></div>
<div id="Proverbs6" class="Chapter">
<span class="MySon">My son</span>, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,<br/>
2 Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.<br/>
3 Do this now, <span class="MySon">My son</span>, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.<br/>
4 Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.<br/>
5 Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.<br/>
6 Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her <span class="way">ways</span>, and be wise:<br/>
7 Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,<br/>
8 Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.<br/>
9 How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?<br/>
10 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:<br/>
11 So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.<br/>
12 A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.<br/>
13 He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;<br/>
14 Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.<br/>
15 Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.<br/>
16 These six things doth the Lord hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him:<br/>
17 A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,<br/>
18 An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,<br/>
19 A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.<br/>
20 <span class="MySon">My son</span>, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:<br/>
21 Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck.<br/>
22 When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.<br/>
23 For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the <span class="way">way</span> of <span class="li-fe">life</span>:<br/>
24 To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.<br/>
25 Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.<br/>
26 For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adultress will hunt for the precious <span class="li-fe">life</span>.<br/>
27 Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?<br/>
28 Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?<br/>
29 So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.<br/>
30 Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;<br/>
31 But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.<br/>
32 But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.<br/>
33 A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.<br/>
34 For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.<br/>
35 He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.<br/>
</div>

<div class="ChapterNumber"><h1>Proverbs 7</h1></div>
<div id="Proverbs7" class="Chapter">
<span class="MySon">My son</span>, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.<br/>
2 Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.<br/>
3 Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.<br/>
4 Say unto <span class="Wisdom">wisdom</span>, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman:<br/>
5 That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth with her words.<br/>
6 For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,<br/>
7 And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,<br/>
8 Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the <span class="way">way</span> to her house,<br/>
9 In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:<br/>
10 And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.<br/>
11 (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:<br/>
12 Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)<br/>
13 So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him,<br/>
14 I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.<br/>
15 Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.<br/>
16 I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt.<br/>
17 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.<br/>
18 Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.<br/>
19 For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey:<br/>
20 He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed.<br/>
21 With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.<br/>
22 He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;<br/>
23 Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his <span class="li-fe">life</span>.<br/>
24 Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.<br/>
25 Let not thine heart decline to her <span class="way">ways</span>, go not astray in her <span class="path">paths</span>.<br/>
26 For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have been slain by her.<br/>
27 Her house is the <span class="way">way</span> to hell, going down to the chambers of death.<br/>

Doth not <span class="Wisdom">wisdom</span> cry? and understanding put forth her voice?<br/>
2 She standeth in the top of high places, by the <span class="way">way</span> in the places of the <span class="path">paths</span>.<br/>
3 She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.<br/>
4 Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.<br/>
5 O ye simple, understand <span class="Wisdom">wisdom</span>: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.<br/>

7 For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.<br/>
8 All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing froward or perverse in them.<br/>
9 They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.<br/>
10 Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.<br/>
11 For <span class="Wisdom">wisdom</span> is <span class="bet-ter">better</span> than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.<br/>
12 I <span class="Wisdom">wisdom</span> dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.<br/>

16 By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.<br/>
17 I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.<br/>
18 Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness.<br/>
19 My fruit is <span class="bet-ter">better</span> than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.<br/>
20 I lead in the <span class="way">way</span> of righteousness, in the midst of the <span class="path">paths</span> of judgment:<br/>
21 That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.<br/>
22 The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his <span class="way">way</span>, before his works of old.<br/>
23 I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.<br/>
24 When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water.<br/>
25 Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:<br/>
26 While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.<br/>
27 When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:<br/>
28 When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:<br/>
29 When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:<br/>
30 Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him;<br/>
31 Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men.<br/>
32 Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are they that keep my <span class="way">ways</span>.<br/>
33 Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.<br/>
34 Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.<br/>
35 For whoso findeth me findeth <span class="li-fe">life</span>, and shall obtain favour of the Lord.<br/>
36 But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.<br/>

2 Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth from death.<br/>
3 The Lord will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he casteth away the substance of the wicked.<br/>
4 He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich.<br/>
5 He that gathereth in summer is a wise son: but he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame.<br/>
6 Blessings are upon the head of the just: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.<br/>
7 The memory of the just is blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot.<br/>
8 The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating fool shall fall.<br/>
9 He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that perverteth his <span class="way">ways</span> shall be known.<br/>
10 He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating fool shall fall.<br/>
11 The mouth of a righteous man is a well of <span class="li-fe">life</span>: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.<br/>
12 Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins.<br/>
13 In the lips of him that hath understanding <span class="Wisdom">wisdom</span> is found: but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding.<br/>
14 Wise men lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish is near destruction.<br/>
15 The rich man's wealth is his strong city: the destruction of the poor is their poverty.<br/>
16 The labour of the righteous tendeth to <span class="li-fe">life</span>: the fruit of the wicked to sin.<br/>
17 He is in the <span class="way">way</span> of <span class="li-fe">life</span> that keepeth instruction: but he that refuseth reproof erreth.<br/>
18 He that hideth hatred with lying lips, and he that uttereth a slander, is a fool.<br/>
19 In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips is wise.<br/>
20 The tongue of the just is as choice silver: the heart of the wicked is little worth.<br/>
21 The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of <span class="Wisdom">wisdom</span>.<br/>
22 The blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.<br/>
23 It is as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of understanding hath <span class="Wisdom">wisdom</span>.<br/>
24 The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire of the righteous shall be granted.<br/>
25 As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no more: but the righteous is an everlasting foundation.<br/>
26 As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to them that send him.<br/>
27 <span class="TheFearOfTheLord">The fear of the Lord</span> prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.<br/>
28 The hope of the righteous shall be gladness: but the expectation of the wicked shall perish.<br/>
29 The <span class="way">way</span> of the Lord is strength to the upright: but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity.<br/>
30 The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth.<br/>
31 The mouth of the just bringeth forth <span class="Wisdom">wisdom</span>: but the froward tongue shall be cut out.<br/>
32 The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the mouth of the wicked speaketh frowardness.<br/>

6 The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness.<br/>
7 When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish: and the hope of unjust men perisheth.<br/>
8 The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead.<br/>
9 An hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but through knowledge shall the just be delivered.<br/>
10 When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: and when the wicked perish, there is shouting.<br/>
11 By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.<br/>
12 He that is void of <span class="Wisdom">wisdom</span> despiseth his neighbour: but a man of understanding holdeth his peace.<br/>

20 They that are of a froward heart are abomination to the Lord: but such as are upright in their <span class="way">way</span> are his delight.<br/>
21 Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.<br/>
22 As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman which is without discretion.<br/>
23 The desire of the righteous is only good: but the expectation of the wicked is wrath.<br/>
24 There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.<br/>
25 The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself.<br/>
26 He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: but blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it.<br/>
27 He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour: but he that seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him.<br/>
28 He that trusteth in his riches shall fall; but the righteous shall flourish as a branch.<br/>
29 He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind: and the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart.<br/>
30 The fruit of the righteous is a tree of <span class="li-fe">life</span>; and he that winneth souls is wise.<br/>

19 A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and their contentions are like the bars of a castle.<br/>
20 A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.<br/>
21 Death and <span class="li-fe">life</span> are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.<br/>
22 Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the Lord.<br/>
23 The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.<br/>
24 A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.<br/>

<span class="bet-ter">Better</span> is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool.<br/>
2 Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good; and he that hasteth with his feet sinneth.<br/>
3 The foolishness of man perverteth his <span class="way">way</span>: and his heart fretteth against the Lord.<br/>
4 Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour.<br/>
5 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall not escape.<br/>
6 Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts.<br/>
7 All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth them with words, yet they are wanting to him.<br/>

9 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall perish.<br/>
10 Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes.<br/>
11 The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and it is his glory to pass over a transgression.<br/>
12 The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour is as dew upon the grass.<br/>
13 A foolish son is the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.<br/>
14 House and riches are the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife is from the Lord.<br/>
15 Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.<br/>
16 He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; but he that despiseth his <span class="way">ways</span> shall die.<br/>

18 Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying.<br/>
19 A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver him, yet thou must do it again.<br/>

21 There are many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of the Lord, that shall stand.<br/>

24 A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.<br/>
25 Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge.<br/>

10 Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them are alike abomination to the Lord.<br/>
11 Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure, and whether it be right.<br/>
12 The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the Lord hath made even both of them.<br/>

25 It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy, and after vows to make enquiry.<br/>
26 A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them.<br/>
27 The spirit of man is the candle of the Lord, searching all the inward parts of the belly.<br/>
28 Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by mercy.<br/>

21 As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is a man to his praise.<br/>
22 Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.<br/>
23 Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to thy herds.<br/>
24 For riches are not for ever: and doth the crown endure to every generation?<br/>
25 The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered.<br/>
26 The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of the field.<br/>
27 And thou shalt have goats' milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and for the maintenance for thy maidens.<br/>

<div class="ChapterNumber"><h1>Proverbs 28</h1></div>
<div id="Proverbs28" class="Chapter">
 The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion.<br/>
2 For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof: but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged.<br/>
3 A poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food.<br/>
4 They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them.<br/>
5 Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the Lord understand all things.<br/>
6 <span class="bet-ter">Better</span> is the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than he that is perverse in his <span class="way">ways</span>, though he be rich.<br/>
7 Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son: but he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father.<br/>
8 He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.<br/>
9 He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination.<br/>
10 Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil <span class="way">way</span>, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good things in possession.<br/>
11 The rich man is wise in his own conceit; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out.<br/>
12 When righteous men do rejoice, there is great glory: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden.<br/>
13 He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.<br/>
14 Happy is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief.<br/>
15 As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; so is a wicked ruler over the poor people.<br/>
16 The prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor: but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days.<br/>
17 A man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall flee to the pit; let no man stay him.<br/>
18 Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but he that is perverse in his <span class="way">ways</span> shall fall at once.<br/>
19 He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough.<br/>
20 A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.<br/>
21 To have respect of persons is not good: for for a piece of bread that man will transgress.<br/>
22 He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him.<br/>
23 He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue.<br/>
24 Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no transgression; the same is the companion of a destroyer.<br/>
25 He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the Lord shall be made fat.<br/>
26 He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.<br/>
27 He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.<br/>
28 When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase.<br/>

<div id="Proverbs29" class="Chapter">
He, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.<br/>
2 When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.<br/>
3 Whoso loveth <span class="Wisdom">wisdom</span> rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth his substance.<br/>
4 The king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it.<br/>
5 A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet.<br/>
6 In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare: but the righteous doth sing and rejoice.<br/>
7 The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: but the wicked regardeth not to know it.<br/>
8 Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise men turn away wrath.<br/>
9 If a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage or laugh, there is no rest.<br/>
10 The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul.<br/>
11 A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise man keepeth it in till afterwards.<br/>
12 If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked.<br/>
13 The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the Lord lighteneth both their eyes.<br/>
14 The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be established for ever.<br/>
15 The rod and reproof give <span class="Wisdom">wisdom</span>: but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame.<br/>
16 When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but the righteous shall see their fall.<br/>
17 Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul.<br/>
18 Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy is he.<br/>
19 A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he understand he will not answer.<br/>
20 Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? there is more hope of a fool than of him.<br/>
21 He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become his son at the length.<br/>
22 An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in transgression.<br/>
23 A man's pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit.<br/>
24 Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth cursing, and bewrayeth it not.<br/>
25 The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord shall be safe.<br/>
26 Many seek the ruler's favour; but every man's judgment cometh from the Lord.<br/>
27 An unjust man is an abomination to the just: and he that is upright in the <span class="way">way</span> is abomination to the wicked.<br/>

<div id="Proverbs30" class="Chapter">
The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,<br/>
2 Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man.<br/>
3 I neither learned <span class="Wisdom">wisdom</span>, nor have the knowledge of the holy.<br/>
4 Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell?<br/>
5 Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him.<br/>
6 Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.<br/>
7 Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I die:<br/>
8 Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:<br/>
9 Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the Lord? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.<br/>
10 Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty.<br/>
11 There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother.<br/>
12 There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from their filthiness.<br/>
13 There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.<br/>
14 There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men.<br/>
15 The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things say not, It is enough:<br/>
16 The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough.<br/>
17 The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.<br/>
18 There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not:<br/>
19 The <span class="way">way</span> of an eagle in the air; the <span class="way">way</span> of a serpent upon a rock; the <span class="way">way</span> of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the <span class="way">way</span> of a man with a maid.<br/>
20 Such is the <span class="way">way</span> of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.<br/>
21 For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it cannot bear:<br/>
22 For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat;<br/>
23 For an odious woman when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.<br/>
24 There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they are exceeding wise:<br/>
25 The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer;<br/>
26 The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks;<br/>
27 The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;<br/>
28 The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces.<br/>
29 There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in going:<br/>
30 A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any;<br/>
31 A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom there is no rising up.<br/>
32 If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth.<br/>
33 Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.<br/>

The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him.<br/>
2 What, <span class="MySon">My son</span>? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?<br/>
3 Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy <span class="way">ways</span> to that which destroyeth kings.<br/>
4 It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:<br/>
5 Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.<br/>
6 Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.<br/>
7 Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.<br/>
8 Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.<br/>
9 Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.<br/>
10 Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies.<br/>
11 The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.<br/>
12 She will do him good and not evil all the days of her <span class="li-fe">life</span>.<br/>
13 She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.<br/>
14 She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from afar.<br/>
15 She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.<br/>
16 She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.<br/>
17 She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.<br/>
18 She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth not out by night.<br/>
19 She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.<br/>
20 She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.<br/>
21 She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet.<br/>
22 She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple.<br/>
23 Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.<br/>
24 She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.<br/>
25 Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.<br/>
26 She openeth her mouth with <span class="Wisdom">wisdom</span>; and in her tongue is the law of kindness.<br/>
27 She looketh well to the <span class="way">ways</span> of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.<br/>
28 Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her.<br/>
29 Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.<br/>
30 Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised.<br/>
31 Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.<br/>
