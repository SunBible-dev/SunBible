<h1> Introduction to this web version</h1>
Hi, my name is N.C.R. I wrote this book 4 years ago, and now please to present you with the first web version of the book.
I am the kind of person, that does not really like to throw out old things.
So through out this book you will find the original text that I wrote for this book when I was 15 years old. 
Trust me I was a terrible writer at age 15.
But I have chosen to keep the original text because some of it sounds funny, though thats not the only reason.
Also throughout this book you will find new notes by me in fancy little color boxes, off to the side.
<br/>
  The main purpose of this book is to help you get a lot of the "Sermon on the Mount".
And I hope you are able to do that despite my bad writing.
The main part of each day should be the bible reading.
I have divided the Sermon on the Mount into 21 parts. 
I would recommend reading the entire Sermon on the Mount before you start reading this book.

<div id="Introduction">
<div id="NewIntroNote">
<h1>New Intro/Note</h1>
<p>
Like I said before, in this book I want to help you get a lot from the sermon on the mount. Probably the newer notes by me, that you'll find in color boxes, will be a bit more boring but hopefully a bit more educational than the things I wrote four years ago.
Now let's get to some boring educational facts...
</p>
<p>
Our focus verses for today, the first two verses of Matthew 5 say:
"And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:  And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying."
We can't be certain that Jesus taught this sermon on the mountain. The gospel according to Matthew is the only gospel that contains the sermon on the mount. In the gospel of Luke, you can find similar teachings to what we find in the sermon on the mount. For example, you can find the beatitudes in the Gospel of Luke in what is called the sermon on the plain. But you cannot find the sermon on the mount in any other gospel.
Some of what is written in Matthew 5 through 7 may be made up by the person who wrote the book. But we can be pretty certain that what we find in the Sermon on the Mount(Matthew  5-7) is in line with the teachings of Jesus and it's worth our time studying.

</div>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> This is not the origional introduction, also it is not the updated one.<br/>
  Hi! This is my first book and I am so excited.
  I have just recently memorized the Sermon on the Mount and somehow I got an idea to write a book on the Sermon.
  So in this book I plan study the sermon in depth, but before we study it together, I would like to tell you a little about The sermon on the Mount.
</p>
<p>
   The Sermon on the Mount is an amazing sermon, that was first preached by Jesus Christ. 
   It can be found in 3 of the gospels, but for this book I will be using it as it is found in Matthew 5, 6, and 7.
   The sermon if filled with lot of information about lots of different things which is surprising because it is just a small sermon.
   Jesus was very good with his words and the place that he preached this sermon is symbolic, (I think). 
   He preached this sermon on a mountain top and I believe that you will be headed in the right direction , to the top of a mountain, if you live your life by this sermon.
</p>
<p>
This book is just a little devotional book but I hope it will help you to the top of the mountain, one step at a time. 
The main part for each chapter is the Bible reading.
 You should spend most of your time reading, meditating on it, trying to get a lot out of it, and then go out and start living your life by The Sermon on The Mount.

4 <span class="RedLetters">Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.</span><br/>
5 <span class="RedLetters">Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.</span><br/>
6<span class="RedLetters"> Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.</span><br/>
7<span class="RedLetters"> Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.</span><br/>
8<span class="RedLetters"> Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. </span><br/>
9 <span class="RedLetters">Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.</span><br/>
10<span class="RedLetters"> Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</span><br/>

12<span class="RedLetters"> Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.</span><br/>
<b>- Matthew 5:3-12</b>
</div>
<p>
  I love the beatitudes they are a whole list of things to do so you can be blessed.
  I love blessings. I am sure just about everyone does. So I am going to summarize the beatitudes to make it easier to see what you have to do to be blessed.
<br/>
   If you want to be blessed you must be ....<br/>
... poor in spirit.<br/>
.... meek .<br/>
.... merciful.<br/>
.... pure in heart .<br/>
.... persecuted for righteousness sake .<br/>
...hungry and thirsty for righteousness.
</p>
<p>
  Now I want to go in depth a little and show you what each thing means.
  Most of them are easy to understand so I will only explain the harder ones. 
  The first one, "blessed are the poor in spirit", is a little hard since sometimes people say " blessed are the poor" but that is not what it says. 
  It says, "blessed are the poor in spirit", what it means is that you should be humble, not proud, and know that you are poor and are nothing without Christ.
  The one "blessed are they that mourn" means that God loves you and will be with you when you are sad. 
  Don't you think it would be funny if someone cried just to be blessed.
 </p>
 <p>
    Seeing the beatitudes summarized up there may give you the idea that it is simple to be blessed, but it is not, some of those thing are pretty hard, like the one about being persecuted.
  It is a pretty hard thing to be persecuted, and it takes people who really believe what they believe, to stay strong under persecution. There are many different kinds of persecution.
  For example a teenager may be afraid to say that he is a Christian because his friends are not, and they may pick on him for being a Christian. 
  I have also heard of grownups posting good things on Facebook, and of people running them down. You should stand up for Christ, not only to be blessed, but also because Christ died for you.
  You are responsible for the choices you make, and you can choose to be blessed or cursed.

<h1>Lights for Jesus</h1>
<div id="Matthew5:13-16">
 <span class="RedLetters">Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men. </span>
 14 <span class="RedLetters">Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. </span>
 15<span class="RedLetters"> Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. </span>
 16<span class="RedLetters"> Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. </span>
<b>- Matthew 5:13-16</b>
<p>
I want to get right to the point on this subject. Just about everyone knows that we are to be a light to the world. But do we live our lives in such a way that men will see our good works and glorify our Father which is in heaven? Sadly most Christians don't live that way. Many people think they have to go across the ocean to be a good missionary, but that is wrong. I think that if the Christians would live a good life right where they are at, is the best way to be a missionary, because actions speak louder than words. There are about 99 people watching every real Christian in the country of America, so if you are a Christian you have an amazing opportunity to bring others to Christ.
Today's Bible reading also talked about being a salt to the earth, and you may be wondering, "How can I be salt?". Well everyone knows that salt makes things taste good, so you can be salt by making life taste good. There are many ways you can do this following are some: by treating people with kindness, by not running people down or giving them a hard time, by talking good about them and to them, and by helping people when they need it. There are many other things you can do to others to make their life good and enjoyable. I also want to add that salt preserves things, so if you are Christian it is your job to help preserve the world from hell.
</p>
<p>  
   From reading this chapter you may think man is the only thing that sees you, but God sees and it breaks his heart when people are not being a good representation of him. If you claim to be a Christian you had better live right.
I think that this chapter's Bible reading should be personalized because Jesus was the one that spoke them and he was speaking to you so you should take his words and say, " I am the salt of the earth; but if I have lost my flavor, how shall I be seasoned? I am then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men.I am the light of the world. I am set on a hill and should not be hidden. I am a candle and can choose where I want to set, I can hide myself under a basket, but I should set myself on a candlestick so that I may give light to all that are in the world. I will shine my light in such away that men will see and glorify my Father which is in heaven."

Arise , shine ; for thy light is come , and the glory of the LORD is risen upon thee.<br/>

What the law has not been destroyed?<br/>
Does that mean I still need to keep it?<br/>
18<br/>
Wow, one jot or title shall in no wise pass till all the fulfilled. <br/>
That must mean there's still a law for me to keep but I have heard one cannot keep it all.<br/>
19<br/>
Jesus makes it sound as if I can keep the entire law and teach others to keep it to. <br/>
Mine or your prayer: <br/>
"Jesus this is a hard task will you please help me,   and Jesus is there more to life than keeping the law?"<br/>
Jesus's answer "20".<br/>

Wow so there's more to life than law keeping. Our righteousness must exceed the righteousness of describes in the Pharisees.<br/>
"Lord I'm going to have a busy life. And How do I even begin to be righteous?"<br/>


=================================<br/>

Righteousness and law keeping are 2 different things. Law keeping starts with outward actions. Righteousness starts with the heart. After the heart has been tended, you then can start to keep the law natualy.
</div>
<h1>The Law</h1>
<p>Original Title: "God's Law"</p>
<div id="Matthew5:17-20">
<span class="RedLetters">Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.</span>
 18 <span class="RedLetters">For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.</span>
 19<span class="RedLetters"> Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. </span>
 20 <span class="RedLetters">For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.</span>
<b>- Matthew 5:17-20</b>
</div>
<p>
When I was first writing this chapter I thought who am I that I should tell the people that they should keep God commands, 
But then a thought came to me, "God is the one with the authority and he shares it with his Son". 
So I do not have to tell you to keep and obey God's commands. 
God made the commands and it is his job to tell people that they have to obey them. So He sent his son Jesus to the earth. 
While Jesus was on this earth He said nothing has passed from the law and that nothing will until the heaven and earth pass away. 
He knows what he is talking about, He has authority. So that means that all the law still has to be kept.
</p>
<p>
Another thing Jesus said is that whosoever shall break one of the least of God's commands will be called least in the kingdom of Heaven.
 I think that the least of the commands is the one about resting on the 7th day. I want to make sure that I am not least in the kingdom of heaven,
 that is why I rest on the 7th day and try to teach others to rest on that day too. 
 Jesus did say what would happen to those who broke the least of God's commands, but he did not tell us what would happen if we broke the greatest of his commands. 
 You'll have to use your imagination!
</p>
<p>
Laws to Keep
There are many different laws and commands, but the most known are The Ten Commandments (Exodus 20) and The Meat Eating Laws (Leviticus 11).

<b>- Matthew 5:20-26</b>
</div>
<p>
 Sure there is laws and everything, but isn't there much more to Christianity than that?<br/>
This morning while I was meditating on and reading today's Bible reading, it stood out to me that to be a Christian you have to do much more than to just obey a bunch of laws. Jesus said that except your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees you shall not even be able to go to heaven. The Scribes and the Pharisees were good people, they obeyed all the laws. Yet Jesus said you need to be better than them. In the old testament it says thou shalt not kill, but Jesus said that we should not even get angry at our brothers without cause or say to others, "thou fool".
Thou shalt not kill is a good law, but good laws do not make good people. The Scribes, even though they did not kill, were not good people. Their heart was not right and they had no relationship with God. Christianity is about giving your heart to God. When you do that, you automatically start being good, loving, and kind. You do what's in the law plus much more.
</p>
<p>
  Today's Bible reading also talks about getting right with your brother. There are a couple reasons for this, one is because God does not like sin. Another because sin has consequences, our God is a loving God, He does not like to see people thrown into prison. If you do not get right with your brother though, you will be judged, because our God is also a just God.
</p>
<p class="ClosingVerse">
When we become Christians we are no longer under the law, but above it
doing what's in the law automatically plus much more.<br/>

<h1>More Than The Law - Part 2: Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery</h1>
<p>Original title: "God Allows But You Must Choose"</p>
<div id="Matthew5:27-32">
 <span class="RedLetters">Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:</span>
 28 <span class="RedLetters">But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.</span>
 29<span class="RedLetters"> And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. </span>
 30 <span class="RedLetters">And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. </span>

 32 <span class="RedLetters">But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.</span>
<b>- Matthew 5:27-32</b>
</div>
<p>
  Today's Bible reading talks about divorce. God is totally against divorce, but He allows you to live your life the way you want. Jesus talks about divorce in another place, and he said that Moses allowed it out of the hardness of your hearts.
Our God is a God of love. He does not force you to believe in Him. He does not force you to obey Him. He does not force you to love Him, He just loves you. He makes laws to protect the people that He loves. He allows you to love Him and to obey him, or to dislike Him and disobey Him.

Our God is a loving God; He gives you helpful advice so that your whole body won't be cast into hell. Jesus said that you should pluck your eye out, or cut your hand off if they are causing you to sin. If there is anything in your life that is causing you to sin you should get rid of it. Anything: household appliances, pictures, toys, books, food, friends, clothes, you name it get rid of it. You do not have to get rid of everything; you could learn to use self-control. The main thing though is to try and eliminate as much temptation as possible.

<h1>More Than The Law - Part 3: Thou shalt not forswear thyself</h1>
<p>Original title: "No Oaths or Swearing".</p>

 <span class="RedLetters">Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: </span>
 34<span class="RedLetters"> But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne: </span>

 37<span class="RedLetters"> But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil. </span>
<b>- Matthew 5:33-37</b>
</div>
<p>
  You should never make oaths or swear to anything. When you are in court you should not swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth. If you are a Christian you should always tell the truth, and be known for telling the truth.
  You should not swear because you cannot change anything by it. Jesus said you cannot make one hair black or white. If you cannot change even the color of your hair by swearing, then you could not even change things that really matter. I think it is just a waste of your good breath to swear.
</p>
<p>
  You should just let your speech be simple. Jesus said that you should just let your yes be yes and your no be no. You should not use any words that are stronger than these. Many people today though swear all the time, and are around others doing the same too, so they are used to it. It is their normal everyday language. But among God's people this should not be so.
</p>
<p>
  You need to start listening to yourself and counting the bad words you say, and then try cutting down on the amount of bad words you use each day. Your final goal will be to eliminate them altogether.

<p>
 Telling someone to slap you on the other cheek sounds like a dumb thing to do. It is a dumb thing too, if you are not a Christian, that's because all humans have the sinful get-back-at nature. When you become a Christian you should start living God's way, his ways are higher than our ways. If someone was to slap you on the cheek, you should turn to him and say, "slap the other one". That person would probably not slap you again. If you would have done things your way you might slap him back, and then he would slap you back, and it would go on and on getting worse as it went.
</p>
<p>
  If anyone takes away your tunic or coat, you should not get mad or blow-up about it, because you cannot change anything by getting mad. You should also give him your cloak. If you do things God's way he might just give your stuff back.
As a Christian you should give to them that ask and turn not away him that would like to borrow from you. You, if you are a Christian, should know that all you have was given to you by God. The very God that gave you what you have can restore to you what you gave away and give away. (What will all the things you own profit you if you might lose your own soul? Matthew 16:26)

 48<span class="RedLetters"> Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.</span>
<b>- Matthew 5:43-48</b>
</div>
<p>
  The first thing I want to do today is ask the question "why?”. Why in the world should I love my enemies? Why should I bless those that curse me? Why should I do good to those that hate me? Why should I pray for them which persecute me? O God why?
There are many reasons why.
The first reason is because Jesus Christ said to and He has authority. He said "you have heard that it has been said love your neighbors and hate your enemies, but I command you to love your enemies.”
Another is so you can be a child of God. He loves all and if you want to be his child you must walk the way he walked and love the way He loves, love all. He makes his sun to shine on all and sends rain for those that hate Him and those that love Him.
</p>
<p>
You should also love your enemies because of the reward you get when you die. If you just love those that love you what do you more than others, what makes you think you earned a reward. You must love everyone even your enemies to have the reward of eternal life. If you just do what the publicans do then you will have the same reward as them eternal death.
</p>
<p>
If you are a Christian you are more and should do more than the average person. You should not just salute you friends, because that is what everyone does. You need to do more than other people. You need to salute and be friendly to everyone even your enemies.
</p>
<p>
The last but not least of the reasons is so you can be perfect like your father which is in heaven. No man can ever be completely perfect, but every man can start by loving his enemies, blessing them that curse him, doing good to them that hate him and praying for them which persecute him.

 4 <span class="RedLetters">That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly. </span>
 <b>- Matthew 6:1-4</b>
</div>
<p>
  Today's Bible reading tells you how you should do your alms. The word alms mean charitable deeds or good deeds. Good deeds are like giving money, food, or clothes to the poor, or just being kind to others.
</p>
<p>
You need to make sure that when you do good you are not also being bad at the same time. There are a couple ways to be bad at the same time you are doing good. One way to do this is if you are doing it for the wrong reason and all you want is people to look at you and give you all the glory. You need to make sure you do the right thing for the right reason.
Alms should be done in secret. Jesus said that you should not even let one hand know what the other hand is doing. I think that is getting a little carried away, but you should try to make sure that you are as secretive as possible. You should try to only let the person you are being good to know that you are doing good.

</div>
<p>
If you are someone that would like to know how to pray better than this chapter is for you.
</p>
<p>
God loves people who pray to him and not those who pray to get glory of men. There is certainly a time and place for praying in front of others, but you should not love showing off. Jesus said “be not as the hypocrites who love to pray standing in the corners of the street”.
<br/>
God wants all of you when you pray and if there are distractions your mind probably won't be there while you pray. Jesus said that you should enter into (“your closet”) a place where there are no distractions to pray.
</p>
<p>
You will need to have faith when you pray, and not repeat yourself, knowing that God heard you the first time. God does know what you want before you even ask him but if he blesses you without your asking for it you may take it for granted.
<br/>
The last 2 verses talk about being forgiven. When you ask God to forgive you, you need to make sure that you have forgiven others for the wrong that they have done to you. Jesus said that you will not be forgiven if you do not forgive others.

      Fasting is something we as Christians should do once in awhile. 
      But it is hardly ever done. I know that I hardly ever do it.</p>
      <p>The Bible gives us instruction on how to fast. 
      But it does not tell us when to fast.
       Choosing a time to fast is our responsibility.
        I encourage you to choose a time to fast.</p>

<h1>How to Fast</h1>
<div id="Matthew6:16-18">
<span class="RedLetters">Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. </span>
<span class="RedLetters">Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. </span>
17<span class="RedLetters"> But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; </span>
18<span class="RedLetters"> That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly. </span>
<b>- Matthew 6:16-18</b>
</div>
<p>
 Fasting is something that people often don't talk about or do now days. Jesus must have wanted people to fast though, because he told us how. He said that you should not disfigure your face or appear to be sad. He said to wash your faces and be happy when you fast.
<br/>
What is a fast?
<br/>
A fast is like a prolonged quiet time. It is a time when you do not eat any food. A fast is a time when you do not let anything distract you. It is a time to pray, ask for forgiveness, meditate in God's word, and much more. Fasting is a thing between you and God, so you should not fast to be seen of men.
</p>
<p>
How long and often to fast?<br/>
It was tradition to fast about twice a week. You may not be able to fast that often, so just fast as often as you can. You should fast for about a whole day when you fast, but there is no limit to the amount of time you fast. Jesus fasted for 40 days one time.
</p>
<p>
How important it is to fast?<br/>
There are various reasons for fasting. The one main reason is because God commands us to. You should also fast to grow in your faith and knowledge of God. People also fast when they are going through hard times and they need to get back with God. All these reasons to fast make it important.
</p>

<b>- Matthew 6:19-34</b>
</div>
<p>
If you are a Christian you need to have a different perspective on wealth than the unbeliever, a Christian perspective. Jesus said that you should not lay up treasures on the earth where moth and rust doth corrupt. You need to know that earthly riches are nothing, and lay up for yourself treasures in heaven. When you become a Christian you need to give your whole heart to God. If you have earthly treasures then your heart will not be set on things above.
</p>
<p>
Jesus talks about the eye being the light of the body right in the middle of talking about money. So I think he is using symbolism. He says that if even one of your eyes is evil your whole body will be full of darkness. I think what he means is that if one of your beliefs about money is wrong it will corrupt all your ideas about money.Your beliefs about money is like the foundation of a building, because money is the root of all evil.
</p>
<p>
He also talks about serving two masters, you will hate one or love one, but you can't love both. You cannot serve both God and riches. The way you live your life will show you who you serve.
</p>
<p>
If you are a Christian and want to serve God, you must live by his rules. You need to depend on Him and nothing else. Jesus said you should not even worry about what you are going to eat. God feeds even the birds and shall he not much more feed you, O you of little faith. Are you not much better than many sparrows? You are. You are priceless. You should not worry about your life because you cannot change anything by it, you need to take action and receive the things that God gives you.
</p>
<p>
Why take thought for clothes. If God clothes even the grass of the field shall he not also cloth you. He created the world and knew that you would need clothing. He even created the materials you need for making clothes, like cotton and wool.
</p>
<p>
You need to seek after God and his ways, and he shall bless you with all the other things you need. You need not think for your future or plan ahead to making it big, but you need to do all that you do to the Glory of God working with all your might. You should not worry for the morrow but meet each difficulty as it comes with God by your side. Sufficient unto each day is the evil thereof, do not make more evil by depending on your riches, instead of God.

<p>
  In today’s Bible reading Jesus starts out with a command saying " Judge not". He also gives us one reason "that you be not judged". He is not saying that you will not be judged when you don't judge others.What he is saying is that when you judge others you will bring more judgment upon yourself. There are some things that are not bad and are actually good. If you judge others for doing those things and then do them yourself, you will be judged for it.
</p>
<p>
Jesus asks a question in the next verse, I think it is a silly question. He asks " why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but not the plank that is in your eye". The answer to this question is easy God made us with eyes that see things. It seems that no matter how much you have blocking your eyesight you can always see others faults, because your eyes are always pointed away from you and not towards yourself. It is good that God made us this way and because we are made this way it means that we as Christians should work together to help others see their wrongs. We should also be willing to accept advice from others about what we need to fix in our lives.
</p>
<p>
The last verse in today's Bible reading says not to give that which is holy unto the dogs or to cast your pearls before swine. As a Christian your pearls should be the message of truth, you should share it with everyone, except the dogs or swine. The dogs and swine can be symbols of smart people that can trample you and hurt you. So what I think Jesus is saying is that you should not try to preach the gospel to people who can get the upper hand over you, and can trample you by proving you wrong. You need to study and learn more so that you can prove your faith by facts, then there shall be no more people that can trample you.

In the first 2 verses it looks as if Jesus repeats himself, but He does not. In the first verse gives the command to, "ask", and in the second verse he gives a reason, "for every one that asks receives". If you ever want something all you have to do is ask.

Jesus uses some down to earth examples, and also says that if man, who is sinful, can give good gifts to them that ask how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask Him.
</p>
<p>
Many people know that God knows our request before we ask him and wonder why we have to even ask him. The reason is because God wants us to depend on Him, if he just gave us things before we ask for them or know that we even have need of them then we would not have to depend on Him.

  There are only two main ways to live your life by, and only two destinations. You can live your life any way you want but you are responsible for the turns and choices you make. The road to heaven is narrow, so if you want to get there you will have to travel on that road. You will have to do what I call "narrowing up" to be able to fit on that path. You will have to let go of the things that you cling to, like your money, good job, or any other earthly treasures. With those treasures your arms would be full and you would be too fat to fit on the Narrow road. It is hard to stay on that road because there are distractions. You will have to throw more things away from you so that you will be skinnier and then you will be able to get and hold weapons, to protect yourself from evil. Weapons include prayer and the Bible, your double edged sword.
I like to imagine that the road to hell is like a huge circle. You can go in just about any and every direction and still be on the road to hell. You can even be good and still be on the road to hell.

If you are born again you will know it and should know whether you are going to heaven or not.

Jesus gives us a warning against false prophets today. He tells us how we will be able to know them so that we can stay away from them. He compares humans to trees and says that all you have to do is look at them and see what kind of fruit they produce. The false prophets will produce bad fruit and the good people will produce good fruit. If you are truly a Christian you will produce the fruit of the spirit which is love, joy, peace, long suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, and temperance.
  Many people who become Christians still appear to be producing bad fruit. There are few reasons for this. One because they may not truly be Christians. Another is that no one is perfect. Apple trees produce good fruit but sometimes the fruit it produces has defects.
</p>
<p>
We have a plum tree at our house, every spring it looks nice with lots of flowers, but it never produces any fruit. We do not like that tree and plan to cut it down and burn it. Jesus says that is what will happen to people if they do not produce good fruit. So if you are a Christian you better produce fruit.

  I said in chapter 17 that we had a plum tree at our house that we do not like. Well when some friends of my mom’s read that chapter they phoned us up to save the tree.

  Our plum trees are not the only trees that have people interceding for them. You also have someone interceding for you, His name is Jesus. He really wants to save you and knows of a way to help you produce. He can only do so much to help you. The job of producing fruit is your job. It will soon be too late then Jesus will not be able to help you anymore. Produce fruit before it is too late.

<b>Galatians 5:22-23</b><br/>
22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, 23 Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.

<h1>Many Will Call On Jesus Name</h1>
<div id="Matthew7:21-23">
 <span class="RedLetters">Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. </span>
 22<span class="RedLetters"> Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? </span>
 23<span class="RedLetters"> And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.</span>
<b>- Matthew 7:21-23</b>
</div>
<p>
Jesus said that many will call unto him in the end time. He said that people will say "have we not prophesied, cast out devils, and done good deeds in thy name". He is going to say to them "I never knew you" and he is going to tell them to depart from him.
</p>
<p>
You may be wondering then how will a person even make it to heaven. The first verse of today's Bible reading tells us " he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven." It is good for those other things to be done(prophesying, casting out devils,and other good deeds), but only if that is God's will for you and your life. God has his will for you and that is the best thing you can spend your life on even if there are better things it looks like you can do.You had better start today and try to make sure you are doing God's will for your life.

<h1>Build On The Rock</h1>
<div id="Matthew7:24-27">
 <span class="RedLetters">Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: </span>
 25<span class="RedLetters"> And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock. </span>
 26<span class="RedLetters"> And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand: </span>
 27<span class="RedLetters"> And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it. </span>
<b>- Matthew 7:24-27</b>
</div>
<p>
  I think that everyone knows they are to build on the rock, but they do not know how. Jesus said that whosoever hears this sermon and doeth what is in it will be like a man building on the rock. So if you want to build on the rock you must not only hear God's word but you must also do it. Just building on the rock would be no good. If you just built something light on the rock it would blow away when the wind comes. You need to build your life on Jesus and attach yourself to him.

When I was a little kid my favorite song was The Wise and Foolish Man. My favorite part in it was when the foolish man's house went splat. Now that I am older and know what that splat means, it makes me kind of sad. Every time there is a splat it means that someone else has fallen and will have an everlasting punishment. It is a sad thing to think about. You could be the next person to fall. So you should start building on the rock today.

<h1>Conclusion: More Than Astonisted</h1>
<div id="Matthew7:28-29">
 And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine: 
 29 For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
<b>- Matthew 7:28-28</b>
</div>
<p>
 When Jesus first preached this message the people were astonished at his doctrine. I hope that you are more than astonished, I hope you will go out and start living your life by the sermon. My chief aim in writing this book was to bring glory to God's name. I was wondering how I could do that by just writing a book that talks about the Sermon on the Mount. But it can bring glory to His name if the people who read this book start living by the teachings of the Sermon on the Mount.
You may wonder how you can live your life by it or what there is to live your life by in this sermon. So I am going to simplify the whole sermon to show you really how much there is in it that you should do.
</p>
<p>
In the Sermon on the Mount Jesus said that....<br/>
.....You should be a light for Jesus and shine your light everywhere.<br/>
....You need to keep every command because none have been done away with and you should teach them to others.<br/>
..... You must make your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees.<br/>
......You cannot kill or even say the word fool.<br/>
If you can do all that you're doing well but there is still more.<br/>
.....You should not commit adultery or divorce.<br/>
.... You should not swear.<br/>
.... You must always turn the other cheek.<br/>
....You must love, bless, and pray for your enemies.<br/>
.....You should never do your alms or prayers before people, but you should do a lot of both.<br/>
..... You should fast and be happy about it.<br/>
.... You should lay up for yourself treasures in heaven rather than on this earth.<br/>
.... You can never judge, and should never cast your pearls before swine.<br/>
.... You must always treat others the way you want treated.<br/>
.....You will have to give up all you got just so you will be able to fit through the narrow "canyon".<br/>
...You will have to produce fruit and do the will of God.
</p>
<p>
If you can do all that, you are doing good, but if you want to be blessed you will have to do all this and a lot more. Jesus also said that whosoever heareth these sayings of his and doeth them will be likened onto a man which builds his house on a rock. It is a lot to do all at once so I would recommend taking it one step at a time.
