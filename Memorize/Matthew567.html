<br/>
6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.
<br/>
7 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.
<br/>
8 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
<br/>
9 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.
<br/>
10 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
<br/>
11 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.
<br/>
12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.
<br/>
13 Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.
<br/>
14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.
<br/>
15 Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.
<br/>
16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.
<br/>
17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.
<br/>
18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.
<br/>
19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.
<br/>
20 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.
<br/>
21 Ye have heard that it was said of them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:
<br/>
22 But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.
<br/>
23 Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;
<br/>
24 Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.
<br/>
25 Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.
<br/>
26 Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.
<br/>
27 Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:
<br/>
28 But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.
<br/>
29 And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.
<br/>
30 And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.
<br/>
31 It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:
<br/>
32 But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.
<br/>
33 Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:
<br/>
34 But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne:
<br/>
35 Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.
<br/>
36 Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.
<br/>
37 But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.
<br/>
38 Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:
<br/>
39 But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.
<br/>
40 And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.
<br/>
41 And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.
<br/>
42 Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.
<br/>
43 Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.
<br/>
44 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;
<br/>
45 That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.
<br/>
46 For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?
<br/>
47 And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?
<br/>
48 Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.

<div class="Matthew6">
<h1>Matthew 6</h1>
Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.
<br/>
2 Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
<br/>
3 But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:
<br/>
4 That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.
<br/>
5 And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
<br/>
6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.
<br/>
7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.
<br/>
8 Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.
<br/>
9 After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.
<br/>
10 Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.
<br/>
11 Give us this day our daily bread.
<br/>
12 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.
<br/>
13 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.
<br/>
14 For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:
<br/>
15 But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
<br/>
16 Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
<br/>
17 But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;
<br/>
18 That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.
<br/>
19 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:
<br/>
20 But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:
<br/>
21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
<br/>
22 The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.
<br/>
23 But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!
<br/>
24 No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
<br/>
25 Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?
<br/>
26 Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?
<br/>
27 Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?
<br/>
28 And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:
<br/>
29 And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
<br/>
30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?
<br/>
31 Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?
<br/>
32 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.
<br/>
33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.
<br/>
34 Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.
</div>

<div class="Matthew7">
<h1>Matthew 7</h1>
Judge not, that ye be not judged.
<br/>
2
For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.
<br/>
3
And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?
<br/>
4
Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?
<br/>
5
Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.
<br/>
6
Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.
<br/>
7
Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:
<br/>
8
For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.
<br/>
9
Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?
<br/>
10
Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?
<br/>
11
If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?
<br/>
12
Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.
<br/>
13
Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:
<br/>
14
Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.
<br/>
15
Beware
of
false
prophets,
which
come
to
you
in
sheep's
clothing,
but
inwardly
they
are
ravening
wolves.
<br/>
16
Ye
shall
know
them
by
their
fruits.
Do
men
gather
grapes
of
thorns,
or
figs
of
thistles?
<br/>
17
Even
so
every
good
tree
bringeth
forth
good
fruit;
but
a
corrupt
tree
bringeth
forth
evil
fruit.
<br/>
18
A
good
tree
cannot
bring
forth
evil
fruit,
neither
can
a
corrupt
tree
bring
forth
good
fruit.
<br/>
19
Every
tree
that
bringeth
not
forth
good
fruit
is
hewn
down,
and
cast
into
the
fire.
<br/>
20
Wherefore
by
their
fruits
ye
shall
know
them.
<br/>
21
Not
every
one
that
saith
unto
me,
Lord,
Lord,
shall
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven;
but
he
that
doeth
the
will
of
my
Father
which
is
in
heaven.
<br/>
22
Many
will
say
to
me
in
that
day,
Lord,
Lord,
have
we
not
prophesied
in
thy
name?
and
in
thy
name
have
cast
out
devils?
and
in
thy
name
done
many
wonderful
works?
<br/>
23
And
then
will
I
profess
unto
them,
I
never
knew
you:
depart
from
me,
ye
that
work
iniquity.
<br/>
24
Therefore
whosoever
heareth
these
sayings
of
mine,
and
doeth
them,
I
will
liken
him
unto
a
wise
man,
which
built
his
house
upon
a
rock:
<br/>
25
And
the
rain
descended,
and
the
floods
came,
and
the
winds
blew,
and
beat
upon
that
house;
and
it
fell
not:
for
it
was
founded
upon
a
rock.
