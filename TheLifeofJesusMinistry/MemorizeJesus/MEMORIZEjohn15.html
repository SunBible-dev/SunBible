                         <span class="red M">I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.</span>
                        2<span class="red M"> Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.</span>
                        3<span class="red M"> Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.</span>
                        4 <span class="red M">Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.</span>
                        5<span class="red M"> I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.</span>
                        6 <span class="red M">If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.</span>
                        7<span class="red M"> If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.</span>
                        8 <span class="red M">Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.</span>
                        9<span class="red M"> As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.</span>
                        10<span class="red M"> If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.</span>
                        11 <span class="red M">These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.</span>
                        12 <span class="red M">This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.</span>
                        13 <span class="red M">Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</span>
                        14 <span class="red M">Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.</span>
                        15<span class="red M"> Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.</span>
                        16 <span class="red M">Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.</span>
                        17<span class="red M"> These things I command you, that ye love one another.</span>
                        18 <span class="red M">If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.</span>
                        19<span class="red M"> If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</span>
                        20<span class="red M"> Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.</span>
                        21 <span class="red M">But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.</span>
                        22 <span class="red M">If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin.</span>
                        23<span class="red M"> He that hateth me hateth my Father also.</span>
                        24 <span class="red M">If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.</span>
                        25 <span class="red M">But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.</span>
                        26<span class="red M"> But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:</span>
                        27 <span class="red M">And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.</span>
