                         <div id="Chapter6">
                        <span class="ChapterNumber">6</span>
                        <span class="red M">Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.</span>
                        2<span class="red M"> Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</span>
                        3 <span class="red M">But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:</span>
                        4<span class="red M"> That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.</span>
                        5 <span class="red M">And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</span>
                        6<span class="red M"> But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.</span>
                        7<span class="red M"> But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.</span>
                        8 <span class="red M">Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.</span>
                        9<span class="red M"> After this manner therefore pray ye</span>:
                        <span class="red M">Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.</span><br/>
                        10<span class="red M"> Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.</span><br/>
                        11<span class="red M"> Give us this day our daily bread.</span><br/>
                        12<span class="red M"> And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</span><br/>
                        13<span class="red M"> And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.</span><br/>
                        14<span class="red M"> For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:</span>
                        15 <span class="red M"> But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</span>
                        16<span class="red M"> Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</span>
                        17<span class="red M"> But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;</span>
                        18<span class="red M"> That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</span>
                        19<span class="red M"> Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:</span>
                        20<span class="red M"> But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:</span>
                        21<span class="red M"> For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</span>
                        22<span class="red M"> The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.</span>
                        23<span class="red M"> But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!</span>
                        24<span class="red M"> No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</span>
                        25<span class="red M"> Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?</span>
                        26<span class="red M"> Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?</span>
                        27 <span class="red M">Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?</span>
                        28<span class="red M"> And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:</span>
                        29 <span class="red M">And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</span>
                        30 <span class="red M">Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?</span>
                        31 <span class="red M">Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?</span>
                        32<span class="red M"> (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.</span>
                        33<span class="red M"> But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.</span>
                        34 <span class="red M">Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.</span>

                        <span class="red M"> Judge not, that ye be not judged.</span>
                        2 <span class="red M">For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.</span>
                        3<span class="red M"> And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?</span>
                        4 <span class="red M">Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?</span>
                        5<span class="red M"> Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.</span>
                        6<span class="red M"> Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.</span>
                        7 <span class="red M">Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:</span>
                        8 <span class="red M">For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.</span>
                        9<span class="red M"> Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?</span>
                        10<span class="red M"> Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?</span>
                        11 <span class="red M">If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?</span>
                        12<span class="red M"> Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.</span>
                        13<span class="red M"> Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:</span>
                        14<span class="red M"> Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.</span>
                        15<span class="red M"> Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</span>
                        16<span class="red M"> Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?</span>
                        17<span class="red M"> Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.</span>
                        18<span class="red M"> A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</span>
                        19<span class="red M"> Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</span>
