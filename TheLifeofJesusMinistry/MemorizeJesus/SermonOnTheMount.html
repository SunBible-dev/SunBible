                        5 <span class="red M">And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</span>
                        6<span class="red M"> But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.</span>
                        7<span class="red M"> But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.</span>
                        8 <span class="red M">Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.</span>
                        9<span class="red M"> After this manner therefore pray ye</span>:
                        <span class="red M">Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.</span><br/>
                        10<span class="red M"> Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.</span><br/>
                        11<span class="red M"> Give us this day our daily bread.</span><br/>
                        12<span class="red M"> And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</span><br/>
                        13<span class="red M"> And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.</span><br/>
                        14<span class="red M"> For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:</span>
                        15 <span class="red M"> But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</span>
                        16<span class="red M"> Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</span>
                        17<span class="red M"> But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;</span>
                        18<span class="red M"> That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</span>
                        19<span class="red M"> Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:</span>
                        20<span class="red M"> But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:</span>
                        21<span class="red M"> For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</span>
                        22<span class="red M"> The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.</span>
                        23<span class="red M"> But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!</span>
                        24<span class="red M"> No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</span>
                        25<span class="red M"> Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?</span>
                        26<span class="red M"> Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?</span>
                        27 <span class="red M">Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?</span>
                        28<span class="red M"> And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:</span>
                        29 <span class="red M">And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</span>
                        30 <span class="red M">Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?</span>
                        31 <span class="red M">Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?</span>
                        32<span class="red M"> (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.</span>
                        33<span class="red M"> But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.</span>
                        34 <span class="red M">Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.</span>

                        <span class="red M"> Judge not, that ye be not judged.</span>
                        2 <span class="red M">For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.</span>
                        3<span class="red M"> And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?</span>
                        4 <span class="red M">Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?</span>
                        5<span class="red M"> Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.</span>
                        6<span class="red M"> Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.</span>
                        7 <span class="red M">Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:</span>
                        8 <span class="red M">For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.</span>
                        9<span class="red M"> Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?</span>
                        10<span class="red M"> Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?</span>
                        11 <span class="red M">If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?</span>
                        12<span class="red M"> Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.</span>
                        13<span class="red M"> Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:</span>
                        14<span class="red M"> Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.</span>
                        15<span class="red M"> Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</span>
                        16<span class="red M"> Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?</span>
                        17<span class="red M"> Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.</span>
                        18<span class="red M"> A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</span>
                        19<span class="red M"> Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</span>
                        20 <span class="red M">Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.</span>
                        21<span class="red M"> Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.</span>
                        22<span class="red M"> Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?</span>
                        23<span class="red M"> And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.</span>
