                        And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came unto him:
                        2 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,<br/>
                        <p style="text-align: center;">
                        3 <span style="color: red;">Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</span><br/>
                        4<span style="color: red;"> Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.</span><br/>
                        5<span style="color: red;"> Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.</span><br/>
                        6<span style="color: red;"> Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.</span><br/>
                        7 <span style="color: red;">Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.</span><br/>
                        8<span style="color: red;"> Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God. </span><br/>
                        9 <span style="color: red;">Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.</span><br/>
                        10<span style="color: red;"> Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</span><br/>
                        11 <span style="color: red;">Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.</span><br/>
                        12 <span style="color: red;">Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.</span><br/>
                        </p>
                        13 <span style="color: red;">Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.</span>
                        14<span style="color: red;"> Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.</span>
                        15 <span style="color: red;">Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.</span>
                        16 <span style="color: red;">Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.</span>
                        17<span style="color: red;"> Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.</span>
                        18<span style="color: red;"> For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.</span>
                        19<span style="color: red;"> Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</span>
                        20<span style="color: red;"> For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.</span>
                        21<span style="color: red;"> Ye have heard that it was said of them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:</span>
                        22<span style="color: red;"> But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.</span>
                        23<span style="color: red;"> Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;</span>
                        24<span style="color: red;"> Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</span>
                        25<span style="color: red;"> Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.</span>
                        26<span style="color: red;"> Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.</span>
                        27<span style="color: red;"> Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery:</span>
                        28 <span style="color: red;">But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.</span>
                        29 <span style="color: red;">And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.</span>
                        30<span style="color: red;"> And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.</span>
                        31<span style="color: red;"> It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement:</span>
                        32<span style="color: red;"> But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.</span>
                        33<span style="color: red;"> Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths:</span>
                        34<span style="color: red;"> But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne:</span>
                        35 <span style="color: red;">Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.</span>
                        36<span style="color: red;"> Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.</span>
                        37<span style="color: red;"> But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.</span>
                        38 <span style="color: red;">Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth:</span>
                        39<span style="color: red;"> But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.</span>
                        40 <span style="color: red;">And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also.</span>
                        41 <span style="color: red;">And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.</span>
                        42<span style="color: red;"> Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.</span>
                        43<span style="color: red;"> Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.</span>
                        44 <span style="color: red;">But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;</span>
                        45<span style="color: red;"> That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.</span>
                        46<span style="color: red;"> For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same?</span>
                        47<span style="color: red;"> And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?</span>
                        48 <span style="color: red;"> Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.</span>

                        <span style="color: red;">Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.</span>
                        2<span style="color: red;"> Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</span>
                        3 <span style="color: red;">But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:</span>
                        4<span style="color: red;"> That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.</span>
                        5 <span style="color: red;">And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</span>
                        6<span style="color: red;"> But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.</span>
                        7<span style="color: red;"> But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.</span>
                        8 <span style="color: red;">Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.</span>
                        9<span style="color: red;"> After this manner therefore pray ye</span>:
                        <p style="text-align: center;">
                        <span style="color: red;">Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.</span><br/>
                        10<span style="color: red;"> Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.</span><br/>
                        11<span style="color: red;"> Give us this day our daily bread.</span><br/>
                        12<span style="color: red;"> And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</span><br/>
                        13<span style="color: red;"> And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.<br/>
                        </p>
                        </span>
                        14<span style="color: red;"> For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:</span>
                        15 <span style="color: red;"> But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</span>
                        16<span style="color: red;"> Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</span>
                        17<span style="color: red;"> But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;</span>
                        18<span style="color: red;"> That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.</span>
                        19<span style="color: red;"> Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:</span>
                        20<span style="color: red;"> But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:</span>
                        21<span style="color: red;"> For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</span>
                        22<span style="color: red;"> The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.</span>
                        23<span style="color: red;"> But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!</span>
                        24<span style="color: red;"> No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</span>
                        25<span style="color: red;"> Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?</span>
                        26<span style="color: red;"> Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?</span>
                        27 <span style="color: red;">Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?</span>
                        28<span style="color: red;"> And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:</span>
                        29 <span style="color: red;">And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</span>
                        30 <span style="color: red;">Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?</span>
                        31 <span style="color: red;">Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?</span>
                        32<span style="color: red;"> (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.</span>
                        33<span style="color: red;"> But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.</span>
                        34 <span style="color: red;">Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.</span>

                        2 <span style="color: red;">For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.</span>
                        3<span style="color: red;"> And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?</span>
                        4 <span style="color: red;">Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?</span>
                        5<span style="color: red;"> Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.</span>
                        6<span style="color: red;"> Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.</span>
                        7 <span style="color: red;">Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:</span>
                        8 <span style="color: red;">For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.</span>
                        9<span style="color: red;"> Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?</span>
                        10<span style="color: red;"> Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?</span>
                        11 <span style="color: red;">If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?</span>
                        12<span style="color: red;"> Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.</span>
                        13<span style="color: red;"> Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:</span>
                        14<span style="color: red;"> Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.</span>
                        15<span style="color: red;"> Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</span>
                        16<span style="color: red;"> Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?</span>
                        17<span style="color: red;"> Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.</span>
                        18<span style="color: red;"> A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</span>
                        19<span style="color: red;"> Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</span>
                        20 <span style="color: red;">Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.</span>
                        21<span style="color: red;"> Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.</span>
                        22<span style="color: red;"> Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?</span>
                        23<span style="color: red;"> And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.</span>
                        24<span style="color: red;"> Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:</span>
                        25<span style="color: red;"> And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.</span>
                        26<span style="color: red;"> And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:</span>
                        27<span style="color: red;"> And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.</span>
                        28 And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine:
                        29 For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.
